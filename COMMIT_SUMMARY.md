# Commit Summary: Perps Tab UI Refactor Based on QA Feedback

## 📋 Quick Summary

Refactored the Perps tab view to improve UX based on user's trading state. The "Start a new trade" CTA now dynamically appears in the appropriate section based on whether the user has orders, positions, or both.

## 🔄 Key Changes

### Component Changes (`PerpsTabView.tsx`)

```diff
+ Extracted renderStartTradeCTA() as a reusable function
+ CTA now appears in orders section when user has orders but no positions
- Removed empty state text for positions (returns null instead)
```

### Control Bar Changes (`PerpsTabControlBar.tsx`)

```diff
- PnL pill no longer shows when user only has orders
+ PnL pill only displays when user has active positions
```

## 📊 Test Results

- **Total Tests**: 21
- **Status**: ✅ All Passing
- **New Tests Added**: 4
- **Coverage Areas**: CTA placement, empty states, section visibility

## 🧪 Test Scenarios Covered

1. **Orders Only** → CTA in orders section, no PnL pill
2. **Positions Only** → CTA in positions section, shows PnL pill
3. **Both Orders & Positions** → Single CTA in positions section
4. **No Holdings** → No empty state text, no CTA

## 💡 Why These Changes?

**Problem**: Users with orders but no positions saw confusing UI with empty state messages and misplaced CTAs.

**Solution**: Smart CTA placement that adapts to user's current state, encouraging continued engagement while reducing visual clutter.

## 🚀 Impact

- Better user flow for traders with pending orders
- Cleaner interface with less redundant messaging
- More intuitive CTA placement based on context
- Correct display of financial indicators (PnL only for positions)

# Pre-push hook: Validates Prettier formatting and ESLint errors before pushing
# Purpose: Prevents unformatted code from reaching remote branches, catching issues
# that slip through `git commit --no-verify`. Only blocks on formatting issues and
# ESLint errors (warnings are allowed). Can be bypassed with `git push --no-verify`.

# Deep Link Bridge Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Source Token Balance Not Displayed During Deep Linking
**Problem**: When navigating to the bridge view via deep link, the source token balance was not displayed initially.

**Root Cause**: Tokens created from deep link CAIP parameters lacked balance information. The `useLatestBalance` hook would return `undefined` initially because there was no cached balance, causing the balance display to be empty while the actual balance was being fetched asynchronously.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `handleSwapUrl` in `/app/core/DeeplinkManager/Handlers/handleSwapUrl.ts` to fetch balance information for tokens before navigation
- Added a `fetchTokenBalance` function that:
  - For EVM tokens: Uses the web3 provider to fetch balance directly
  - For Solana tokens: Retrieves balance from the multichain token list
- Updated the navigation to pass tokens with balance information included

### 2. Quotes Keep Loading During Deep Link Navigation
**Problem**: When navigating to the bridge view via deep link, quotes would keep loading indefinitely.

**Root Cause**: Quote requests were triggered immediately when tokens were set from deep link parameters, but since these tokens initially lacked complete balance information, the quote fetching process could be unstable or incomplete.

**Solution**:
- Modified `hasValidBridgeInputs` calculation in `/app/components/UI/Bridge/Views/BridgeView/index.tsx` to ensure balance has been fetched for deep link tokens before allowing quotes to be triggered
- Added a small delay (100ms) in the quote parameter update effect to ensure balance fetching is complete
- Added a condition to prevent quote fetching until the `latestSourceBalance` is available for deep link navigation

### 3. Improved Balance Display During Loading
**Problem**: While balance was being fetched, the TokenInputArea would show no balance information at all.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `/app/components/UI/Bridge/components/TokenInputArea/index.tsx` to show a loading indicator (`... TokenSymbol`) for source tokens when balance is not yet available but the token is valid

## Code Changes Summary

### 1. `/app/core/DeeplinkManager/Handlers/handleSwapUrl.ts`
- Added imports for balance fetching utilities
- Added `fetchTokenBalance` function to fetch balance for tokens before navigation
- Modified the main `handleSwapUrl` function to:
  - Get the selected address from AccountsController
  - Fetch balance for both source and destination tokens
  - Pass tokens with balance information to the bridge view navigation

### 2. `/app/components/UI/Bridge/Views/BridgeView/index.tsx`
- Enhanced `hasValidBridgeInputs` calculation to ensure balance is fetched for deep link tokens
- Added a timeout delay in the quote parameter update effect to allow balance fetching to complete

### 3. `/app/components/UI/Bridge/components/TokenInputArea/index.tsx`
- Improved balance display logic to show loading indicator (`... TokenSymbol`) when balance is not available for source tokens

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Balance Display**: Users now see their token balance immediately when navigating via deep link
2. **Stable Quote Loading**: Quotes no longer get stuck in loading state during deep link navigation
3. **Better UX**: Loading indicators provide clear feedback when balance is being fetched
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Deep link navigation now behaves consistently with normal bridge navigation

## Testing

The changes maintain backward compatibility and should work with:
- Regular bridge navigation (non-deep link)
- Deep link navigation with complete parameters
- Deep link navigation with partial parameters
- Both EVM and Solana tokens
- All existing bridge functionality

## Implementation Details

- **Balance Fetching**: Uses the same underlying balance fetching logic as the `useLatestBalance` hook
- **Network Switching**: Maintains existing network switching behavior when navigating via deep link
- **Error Handling**: Includes proper error handling and fallbacks for balance fetching
- **Performance**: Minimal performance impact with balance fetching happening before navigation rather than after

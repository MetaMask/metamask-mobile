# wallet_switchEthereumChain.ts Migration to TypeScript

## Changes Made
1. Converted file from JavaScript to TypeScript.
2. Added type annotations for function parameters and variables.
3. Imported necessary types and interfaces.
4. Defined interface for function parameters.

## Type Annotations Added
- WalletSwitchEthereumChainParams interface for function parameters.
- NetworkConfiguration interface for network configuration object.
- Type annotations for local variables and function parameters.

## Issues Resolved
- Added type safety to the function parameters and return values.
- Improved code readability and maintainability with explicit types.

## Remaining Issues
- Some 'any' types still present due to external dependencies lacking proper TypeScript definitions.
- Potential null checks needed for optional chaining and type assertions.

## Next Steps
- Resolve remaining TypeScript errors, particularly those related to external module declarations.
- Consider adding more specific types for Engine.context and analytics object.
- Review and update error handling to ensure type safety.

Feature: Revoking access to a dapp while connected to one account.

    Scenario: Import wallet
        Given the app displayed the splash animation
        And I have imported my wallet
        And I tap No Thanks on the Enable security check screen
        And I tap No thanks on the onboarding welcome tutorial
        And I close the Whats New modal

    Scenario: User grants permission to a dapp to access one of their accounts
        When I navigate to the browser
        And I navigate to "https://metamask.github.io/test-dapp/"
        Then I connect my active wallet to the test dapp

    Scenario: User revokes dapp permission
        When I tap on the Network Icon
        And I tap on button with text "Permissions"
        And I tap on Revoke button
        Then I should not be connected to the dapp

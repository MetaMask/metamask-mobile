    # This feature measures the warm start of the app when:
    # The user imports a wallet and the time it takes to get from launching app to login view

    Scenario: Measure warm start launch time after Importing a Wallet
        Given the app displayed the splash animation
        And I have imported my wallet
        And I tap No Thanks on the Enable security check screen
        And I close all the onboarding modals
        And I am on the wallet view
        When I background the app for 30 seconds
        And the app is move to the foreground
        And the timer starts running
        Then The Login screen should be visible in "2" seconds

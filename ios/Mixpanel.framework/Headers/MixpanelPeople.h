/*!
 Mixpanel People API.

 Access to the Mixpanel People API, available as a property on the main
 Mixpanel API.

 <b>You should not instantiate this object yourself.</b> An instance of it will
 be available as a property of the main Mixpanel object. Calls to Mixpanel
 People methods will look like this:

 <pre>
 [mixpanel.people increment:@"App Opens" by:[NSNumber numberWithInt:1]];
 </pre>

 Please note that the core <code>Mixpanel</code> and
 <code>MixpanelPeople</code> classes share the <code>identify:</code> method.
 The <code>Mixpanel</code> <code>identify:</code> affects the
 <code>distinct_id</code> property of events sent by <code>track:</code> and
 <code>track:properties:</code> and determines which Mixpanel People user
 record will be updated by <code>set:</code>, <code>increment:</code> and other
 <code>MixpanelPeople</code> methods.

 <b>If you are going to set your own distinct IDs for core Mixpanel event
 tracking, make sure to use the same distinct IDs when using Mixpanel
 People</b>.
 */

 controls the $ignore_time property in any subsequent MixpanelPeople operation.

 If the $ignore_time property is present and true in your request,
 Mixpanel will not automatically update the "Last Seen" property of the profile.
 Otherwise, Mixpanel will add a "Last Seen" property associated with the
 current time for all $set, $append, and $add operations

 Defaults to NO.

 Register the given device to receive push notifications.

 This will associate the device token with the current user in Mixpanel People,
 which will allow you to send push notifications to the user from the Mixpanel
 People web interface. You should call this method with the <code>NSData</code>
 token passed to
 <code>application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:</code>.

 Unregister a specific device token from the ability to receive push notifications.

 Set properties on the current user in Mixpanel People.

 The properties will be set on the current user. The keys must be NSString
 objects and the values should be NSString, NSNumber, NSArray, NSDate, or
 NSNull objects. We use an NSAssert to enforce this type requirement. In
 release mode, the assert is stripped out and we will silently convert
 incorrect types to strings using [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@", value]. You
 can override the default the current project token and distinct ID by
 including the special properties: $token and $distinct_id. If the existing
 user record on the server already has a value for a given property, the old
 value is overwritten. Other existing properties will not be affected.

 representing the first time something happened.

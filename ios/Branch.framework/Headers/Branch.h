 `Branch` is the primary interface of the Branch iOS SDK. Currently, all interactions you will make are funneled through this class. It is not meant to be instantiated or subclassed, usage should be limited to the global instance.

  Note, when `getInstance` is called, it assumes that you have already placed a Branch Key in your main `Info.plist` file for your project. For additional information on configuring the Branch SDK, check out the getting started guides in the Readme.

 TL;DR: If you're using a version of the Facebook SDK that prevents application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: from
 returning YES/true when a Universal Link is clicked, you should enable this option.

 Long explanation: in application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: you should choose one of the following:

 1. Always `return YES;`, and do *not* invoke `[[Branch getInstance] accountForFacebookSDKPreventingAppLaunch];`
 2. Allow the Facebook SDK to determine whether `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` returns `YES` or `NO`,
    and invoke `[[Branch getInstance] accountForFacebookSDKPreventingAppLaunch];`

 The reason for this second option is that the Facebook SDK will return `NO` if a Universal Link opens the app
 but that UL is not a Facebook UL. Some developers prefer not to modify
 `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` to always return `YES` and should use this method instead.

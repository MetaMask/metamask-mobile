/**
The `BranchShareLink` class facilitates sharing Branch links using a `UIActivityViewController` 
user experience.

The `BranchShareLink` is a new class that is similar to but has more functionality than the old 
`[BranchUniversalObject showShareSheetWithLinkProperties:...]` methods.

The `BranchShareLink` is initialized with the `BranchUniversalObject` and `BranchLinkProperties` 
objects that will be used to generate the Branch link.

After the `BranchShareLink` object is created, set any configuration properties on the activity 
sheet object, and then call `showFromViewController:anchor:` to show the activity sheet.

A delegate on the BranchShareLink can further configure the share experience. For instance the link 
parameters can be changed depending on the activity that the user selects.

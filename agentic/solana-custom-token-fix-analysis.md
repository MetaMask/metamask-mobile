# Solana Custom Token Fix - Agent Analysis

## Original Prompt
"can you analyze https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/issues/16220 and figure out what is the issue in the source code of the mobile codebase?"

## Follow-up Prompts
1. "can you implement a minimum fix and make a draft PR ?"
2. "you have created a testing plan but you need to actually implement and validate that the PR is fixing the issue. You should create the matching test to isolate that specific issue with the ASBOLUTE minimum test possible. The you must run the test to validate the before / after and that the fix is done. please implement now. you MUST be consistent with existing codebase testing code"
3. "there is INVALID_PR_TEMPLATE now you must respect the correct format for thw description"
4. "Could you create a separate file in an agentic/ folder that would 1) list original prompt that was asked 2) how many follow up prompts were used. Be succint, my goal is to analyze how many steps it tooks to create the fix so It can be fully automated later."
5. "it seems the PR is now has conflict with main, are you able to solve them automatically? Then you can add it to the list of prompt as a step."
6. "continue (I misclicked I wanted to approve!)"
7. "ðŸŽ¯ Task: Complete Solana Custom Token Fix PR for Merge" (comprehensive prompt to ensure all tests pass)

## Total Steps: 7 prompts

## Automation Insights
- Step 1: Issue analysis required understanding redirect logic and transaction flow
- Step 2: Fix implementation touched 3 core areas (transaction recording, token import, error messaging)
- Step 3: Test creation validated the fix with unit and integration tests
- Step 4: PR template compliance required specific markdown format
- Step 5-6: Conflict resolution required merging imports and formatting changes from main branch
- Step 7: Systematic test validation and fixing BridgeView test for Solana swap button text

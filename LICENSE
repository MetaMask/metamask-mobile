MetaMask Mobile is an exciting development for our team and our ecosystem. We've always been proud to offer the MetaMask browser extension under an open source license. We are still working through licensing considerations for the mobile application in light of a new delivery medium and our business goals. We are exploring many models, all with a significant open component, but we have not made any final decisions.

The source code for this is currently viewable under the below copyright. A license to use the mobile version will be distributed along with the mobile application. We believe it is important for our users to be able inspect and verify our code for trustworthiness, but we also wish to preserve our licensing options until we're certain what is best for MetaMask, our community, and our ecosystem. If you have any questions or comments, we would really appreciate hearing your feedback – you can reach us at mobile@metamask.io

# HIP-3 Final Status & Next Steps - TAT-1872

## üìä Current Status: 95% Complete

### ‚úÖ Everything Works EXCEPT Order Routing

**Implemented & Working:**

1. ‚úÖ HIP-3 market detection and fetching
2. ‚úÖ Metadata storage (dexName, deployer, isHip3)
3. ‚úÖ UI badges showing HIP-3 markets
4. ‚úÖ Symbol handling (`"xyz:XYZ100"` format)
5. ‚úÖ Price subscriptions for all HIP-3 DEXs
6. ‚úÖ Asset lookup across all DEXs
7. ‚úÖ Order validation
8. ‚úÖ Fee calculations
9. ‚úÖ Liquidation price calculations
10. ‚úÖ Position and order fetching from all DEXs
11. ‚úÖ Error handling (429 rate limits, null checks)
12. ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging

**NOT Working:**

- ‚ùå DEX routing for order placement (orders go to main DEX instead of HIP-3 DEX)

## üîç What We've Tried

### Attempt 1: vaultAddress Parameter ‚ùå

```typescript
order({ ..., vaultAddress: deployerAddress })
```

**Result:** "Vault not registered" error  
**Reason:** vaultAddress is for vault managers, not DEX routing

### Attempt 2: dex Field in Action ‚ùå

```typescript
order({ orders, grouping, builder, dex: 'xyz' });
```

**Result:** Still routes to main DEX (BTC order placed)  
**Reason:** API doesn't use dex field for routing (or we're passing it wrong)

### Attempt 3: SDK ActionSorter Patch ‚ùå

Modified SDK to preserve `dex` field through actionSorter  
**Result:** Still routes to main DEX  
**Reason:** API doesn't support dex field in order actions

## üéØ The Blocking Question

**How does Hyperliquid UI route orders to HIP-3 DEXs?**

We know:

- ‚úÖ It works seamlessly in their UI
- ‚úÖ No visible transfer transactions
- ‚úÖ Funds automatically available across DEXs
- ‚ùå We can't find the routing mechanism

## üí° Remaining Possibilities

### Theory 1: Separate ExchangeClient Per DEX

Maybe you need:

```typescript
const mainExchangeClient = new ExchangeClient({ wallet, transport });
const xyzExchangeClient = new ExchangeClient({
  wallet,
  transport,
  // Some parameter that sets DEX context?
});
```

### Theory 2: Pre-registration or Opt-in

Maybe users must:

1. "Join" or "enable" a HIP-3 DEX first
2. This associates their wallet with that DEX
3. Then orders automatically route based on asset

### Theory 3: API Version or Endpoint

Maybe:

- Different API endpoint for HIP-3 orders?
- Different transport configuration?
- API version that supports HIP-3?

### Theory 4: We're Using Wrong Asset IDs

Maybe:

- Asset IDs ARE globally unique (not DEX-scoped)
- We should NOT use array indices
- There's a global asset registry we haven't found
- xyz:XYZ100 has a real ID like 10000 not 0

## üìã Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Reach Out to Hyperliquid

1. **Check official Hyperliquid Discord/Telegram**
   - Ask how to place orders on HIP-3 DEXs via API
   - Share that `dex` field doesn't work
2. **Contact SDK maintainer (@deeeed)**

   - Ask if HIP-3 order placement is supported
   - Request examples or documentation

3. **Check Hyperliquid UI source code**
   - app.hyperliquid.xyz might be open source
   - See exactly how they place HIP-3 orders

### Option B: Deep Dive Investigation

1. **Intercept Hyperliquid UI network requests**

   - Use browser DevTools
   - Place xyz:XYZ100 order in their UI
   - Inspect exact API call made
   - Copy the request format

2. **Test perpDexTransfer**

   - Transfer $50 from main DEX to xyz DEX
   - See if having balance in xyz DEX changes routing

3. **Check if collateral location determines routing**
   - Maybe API routes to DEX where you have collateral?
   - Test: Put ALL balance in xyz DEX, then try BTC order
   - Does it fail? Or auto-route to xyz DEX?

### Option C: Workaround for MVP

1. **Document limitation**

   - HIP-3 markets detected and displayed
   - Trading requires using Hyperliquid UI
   - MetaMask shows positions/orders after

2. **Add helpful error**

   - Detect HIP-3 order attempt
   - Show: "Trading HIP-3 assets currently requires using Hyperliquid's official UI"

3. **Link to Hyperliquid**
   - Deep link to app.hyperliquid.xyz with asset pre-selected

## üî¨ Diagnostic Test to Try

**Test if balance location determines routing:**

```bash
# 1. Transfer ALL funds to xyz DEX
perpDexClassTransfer({ dex: "xyz", amount: "9", toPerp: true })

# 2. Check balances
clearinghouseState({ user }) ‚Üí $0
clearinghouseState({ user, dex: "xyz" }) ‚Üí $9

# 3. Try placing BTC order
# If it fails ‚Üí routing is balance-based
# If BTC order succeeds ‚Üí routing is NOT balance-based
```

## üì¶ What Can Be Delivered Now

### Full Package (95% Complete):

- Complete HIP-3 detection and display
- All metadata and UI components
- Price data and subscriptions
- Order validation and calculations
- Known limitation: Routing not solved

### Recommendation:

1. **Merge PR with documented limitation**
2. **File follow-up ticket** for routing investigation
3. **Reach out to Hyperliquid team** for guidance
4. **Add workaround**: Link to Hyperliquid UI for HIP-3 trading

## üéØ Summary

We've implemented everything EXCEPT the final routing piece. This is a tough problem that likely requires:

- Inside knowledge from Hyperliquid team
- Inspecting their UI implementation
- Or discovering undocumented API behavior

**The work done is valuable** - full HIP-3 support infrastructure is ready. Just needs the routing solution.

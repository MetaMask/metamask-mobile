# Welcome to MetaMask!

If you're submitting code to MetaMask, there are some simple things we'd appreciate you doing to help us stay organized!

### Finding the right project

Before taking the time to code and implement something, feel free to open an issue and discuss it! There may even be an issue already open, and together we may come up with a specific strategy before you take your precious time to write code.

There are also plenty of open issues we'd love help with. Search the [`good first issue`](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/contribute) label, or head to Gitcoin and earn ETH for completing projects we've posted bounties on.

If you're picking up a bounty or an existing issue, feel free to ask clarifying questions on the issue as you go about your work.

### Submitting a pull request
When you're done with your project / bugfix / feature and ready to submit a PR, there are a couple guidelines we ask you to follow:

- [ ] **Make sure you followed our [`coding guidelines`](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/blob/main/.github/coding_guidelines/CODING_GUIDELINES.md)**: These guidelines aim to maintain consistency and readability across the codebase. They help ensure that the code is easy to understand, maintain, and modify, which is particularly important when working with multiple contributors.
- [ ] **Test it**: For any new programmatic functionality, we like unit tests when possible, so if you can keep your code cleanly isolated, please do add a test file to the `tests` folder.
- [ ] **Add to the CHANGELOG**: Help us keep track of all the moving pieces by adding an entry to the [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) with a link to your PR.
- [ ] **Meet the spec**: Make sure the PR adds functionality that matches the issue you're closing. This is especially important for bounties: sometimes design or implementation details are included in the conversation, so read carefully!
- [ ] **Close the issue**: If this PR closes an open issue, add the line `fixes #$ISSUE_NUMBER`. Ex. For closing issue 418, include the line `fixes #418`. If it doesn't close the issue but addresses it partially, just include a reference to the issue number, like `#418`.
- [ ] **Keep it simple**: Try not to include multiple features in a single PR, and don't make extraneous changes outside the scope of your contribution. All those touched files make things harder to review ;)
- [ ] **PR against `main`**: Submit your PR against the `main` branch. This is where we merge new features to be included in forthcoming releases. When we initiate a new release, we create a branch named `release/x.y.z`, serving as a snapshot of the `main` branch. This particular branch is utilized to construct the builds, which are then tested during the release regression testing phase before they are submitted to the stores for production. In the event your PR is a hot-fix for a bug identified on the `release/x.y.z` branch, you should still submit your PR against the `main` branch. This PR will subsequently be cherry-picked into the `release/x.y.z` branch by our release engineers.
- [ ] **Get the PR reviewed by code owners**: At least two code owner approvals are mandatory before merging any PR.

And that's it! Thanks for helping out.

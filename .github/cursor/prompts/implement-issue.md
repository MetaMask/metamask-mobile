You are implementing a GitHub issue for the MetaMask Mobile repository.

## Your Task

1. **Understand the Issue**: Read the issue details carefully to understand what needs to be done
2. **Analyze the Codebase**: Search for relevant files and understand the existing patterns
3. **Implement the Solution**: Make the necessary code changes following the project's conventions
4. **Write Tests**: Add unit tests for any new functionality (follow the testing guidelines)
5. **Verify**: Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality

## Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the repository
- Use TypeScript - no `any` types allowed
- Use the design system components from `@metamask/design-system-react-native`
- Add appropriate comments where needed
- Keep changes focused on the issue scope - don't over-engineer

## Pull Request

When creating the PR, read and use the template from `.github/pull-request-template.md`.

**Important**: Follow all instructions marked with `AI agent:` in the template comments. These provide specific guidance on:

- Format requirements (changelog format, issue linking)
- Content requirements (specific vs generic descriptions)
- Checklist handling (which boxes to check/uncheck)

The template is the source of truth - use it as the structure and fill it out completely following the AI agent instructions.

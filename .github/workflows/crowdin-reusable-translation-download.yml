name: Crowdin - Check translation progress and download if complete (unless main)
# This is a reusable workflow that is called by crowdin-pull-branch-pr-completed-translations
# across all branches which have a label of "ready-for-translation" aka being translated.
# This workflow will check the translation progress and download the translations if
# they are 100% translated. If the branch that is running this is main it will skip completion
# check and just pull whatever translations are available.

name: Crowdin - Upload Both Sources and Translations Crowdin Action
# This action is intended to ensure our main branch on crowdin is in sync with our
# main branch on github and will run on every push to main that has changes to any
# locales files.

# TODO: Change to trigger on merge to main when locales files are changed (after testing)
# This should replace the current crowdin_action.yml file (after testing)

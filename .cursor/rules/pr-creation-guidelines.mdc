# MetaMask Mobile Pull Request Guidelines

Follow these rules when creating PRs to ensure consistent quality and smooth reviews.

## Core Principles

Small focused PRs • Clear titles/descriptions • Complete template • Correct labels • Branch naming

## 1. PR Title Requirements

**Format**: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>` (Conventional Commits)

**Types**: feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore|perf|ci|build|revert

**Examples**:

| ✅ Good | ❌ Bad |
|---------|--------|
| `feat: add NFT gallery to collectibles tab` | `Add some stuff` |
| `fix: resolve wallet connection timeout on cold start` | `fixing bug` |
| `refactor: extract transaction formatter into utility` | `refactor code` |
| `test: add e2e spec for onboarding SRP import flow` | `tests` |
| `docs: update contributing guide with design-system usage` | `update docs` |
| `chore: bump react-native to 0.74.5` | `upgrade rn` |

**Rules**: Use imperative mode • Keep concise (<72 chars) • Be specific

## 2. PR Template Compliance

Use `.github/pull-request-template.md` - fill ALL sections:

- **Description**: What changed and why (context, constraints, trade-offs)
- **Changelog**: User-facing summary in past participle (`Added`, `Fixed`) OR `CHANGELOG entry: null`
- **Related issues**: `Fixes: #NUMBER`, `Closes: #NUMBER`, or `Refs: #NUMBER`
- **Manual testing**: test cases desciption using Gherkin syntax (see sample in template)
- **Screenshots/Recordings**: Required for UI changes (before/after)
- **Pre-merge checklist**: Ensure all items checked, even if thye don't apply, it shows that you thought about the specific item.

## 3. Required Labels and Assignment

**PR Assignment**: Assignee is the one who is in charge of making the PR move forward to merge. It's usually the author, but can be delegated.

**Team Label** (REQUIRED - merge will be blocked if missing):
- Must have one: `team-*` label OR `external-contributor`

**Blocking Labels** (these WILL prevent merge):
- `needs-qa` - QA validation required
- `need-ux-ds-review` - UX/Design System review needed  
- `blocked` - Blocked by external dependency
- `stale` - PR is stale and needs attention
- `DO-NOT-MERGE` - Explicit block

**DO**:
- ✅ Assign to person responsible for moving PR forward (usually author)
- ✅ Add team label (required for merge)
- ✅ Remove blocking labels when resolved

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Leave unassigned
- ❌ Use deprecated labels

## 4. Branch Naming

**Format**: `<type>/<issue-number>_<short-kebab-description>` (include issue number when applicable)

**Examples**: 
- `fix/1234_wallet-connection-issue` - with issue number
- `feat/5678_add-nft-gallery` - with issue number
- `chore/update-linting-config` - no issue (maintenance work)
- `refactor/migrate-util-to-ts` - no issue (internal improvement)

**Rules**: Lowercase • Kebab-case • Include issue number when fixing/implementing • Match PR type • Keep description short

## 5. PR Best Practices

- Submit as **Draft** initially for CI
- Mark "Ready for review" only after:
  - Manually tested by yourself first
  - Assigned to yourself
  - Template complete
  - Lint/tests/type-checks pass
  - Screenshots attached (if UI)
  - Labels applied
- Target `main` branch
- Keep focused (single feature/fix)
- Include tests (unit/Component-view/e2e)
- Update TSDoc when relevant

**⚠️ Force Push Policy**:
- **DO NOT use force push** (`git push --force`) once first review is done
- Force push breaks GitHub's "changes since last review" feature
- Reviewers must re-review entire PR instead of just new changes
- If you need to clean history, do it BEFORE requesting first review
- After first review: use regular commits, squash on merge if needed

**DO**: Assign yourself • Keep diff small • Include testing steps • Update docs/changelog • Regular push after reviews

**DON'T**: Leave unassigned • Skip template • Push unrelated changes • Force push after first review

## GitHub CLI Example

```bash
# Create PR with auto team detection
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: add NFT gallery to collectibles tab" \
  --assignee @me \
  --draft
```

## Enforcement

- PRs must use template with all sections complete
- PRs must be assigned
- Titles must follow Conventional Commits
- Blocking labels must be resolved before asking for review
- Non-compliant PRs converted to Draft with comment

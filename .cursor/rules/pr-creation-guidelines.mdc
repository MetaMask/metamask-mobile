# MetaMask Mobile Pull Request (PR) Creation Guidelines

These rules apply whenever creating PRs in the MetaMask Mobile repository or suggesting PR creation steps to others. Follow them to ensure consistent quality and smooth reviews.

## Core Principles

- Prefer small, focused PRs that are easy to review.
- Make PR titles and descriptions clear, specific, and actionable.
- Always use the repository PR template and complete every section.
- Ensure correct labels and branch naming for automation and triage.

## 1. PR Title Requirements

PR titles must follow Conventional Commits and clearly describe the change.

- Allowed types (with brief descriptions):
  - `feat:` For new features or significant enhancements.
  - `fix:` For bug fixes or corrections.
  - `docs:` For documentation changes only.
  - `style:` For code style changes (formatting, whitespace, etc.) that do not affect logic.
  - `refactor:` For code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature (e.g., code restructuring).
  - `test:` For adding or updating tests.
  - `chore:` For routine tasks, maintenance, or changes to build tools and dependencies.
  - `perf:` For performance improvements.
  - `ci:` For changes to CI configuration or scripts.
  - `build:` For changes affecting the build system or external dependencies.
  - `revert:` For reverting previous commits.
- Keep titles concise (ideally under ~72 characters) and specific.
- Use imperative mood after the type (e.g., "add", "fix", "refactor").

### Examples

| ✅ Good                                                    | ❌ Bad           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `feat: add NFT gallery to collectibles tab`                | `Add some stuff` |
| `fix: resolve wallet connection timeout on cold start`     | `fixing bug`     |
| `refactor: extract transaction formatter into utility`     | `refactor code`  |
| `test: add e2e spec for onboarding SRP import flow`        | `tests`          |
| `docs: update contributing guide with design-system usage` | `update docs`    |
| `chore: bump react-native to 0.74.5`                       | `upgrade rn`     |

### Title DO / DON'T

- ✅ DO: Start with a valid type prefix and a short, descriptive phrase
- ✅ DO: Reference scope briefly in the phrase if useful (e.g., "collectibles", "onboarding")
- ❌ DON'T: Include issue numbers or long explanations in the title (put in description)
- ❌ DON'T: Use ambiguous words like "stuff", "things", "fixes" without context

## 2. PR Template Compliance

You must use the template at `.github/pull-request-template.md`. Fill out all sections thoroughly.

- **Description**: What changed and why. Include context, constraints, and trade-offs.
- **Changelog entry**: Provide a user-facing change summary in past participle (e.g., "Added", "Fixed"). If not user-facing, write `CHANGELOG entry: null`.
- **Related issues**: Use `Fixes: #NUMBER`, `Closes: #NUMBER`, or `Refs: #NUMBER` as appropriate.
- **Manual testing steps (Gherkin format)**: Provide reproducible steps reviewers/QA can follow.
- **Screenshots/Recordings**: Required for UI changes (before/after when relevant).
- **Pre-merge checklist**: Ensure all items are checked (lint/tests pass, docs updated, feature flags set, etc.).

### Gherkin Example

```gherkin
Scenario: Import an existing wallet via SRP on fresh install
  Given the app is freshly installed
  And I am on the Welcome screen
  When I tap "Import using Secret Recovery Phrase"
  And I enter a valid 12-word SRP
  And I set a new password
  Then I should land on the Home screen
  And I should see the default account with a balance
```

### Changelog Examples

```text
CHANGELOG entry: Added NFT gallery to Collectibles tab.
CHANGELOG entry: Fixed wallet connection timeout on cold start.
CHANGELOG entry: null
```

## 3. Required Labels and Assignment

### PR Assignment

- **Always assign the PR to yourself (the author)** immediately after creation.
- This ensures proper ownership tracking and notifications.

### Required Labels

Apply labels to enable automation and proper routing. Some labels can block merging.

- **Team labels** (for internal devs): `team-mobile-ux`, `team-mobile-platform`, etc.
- **QA labels**:
  - `needs-qa` (blocks merging until QA passes)
  - `No QA Needed`
  - `Run E2E Smoke`
  - `No E2E Smoke Needed`
  - `Spot check on release build`
- **Blocking labels** (cannot merge while applied): `needs-qa`, `issues-found`, `blocked`, `DO-NOT-MERGE`
- Add any relevant area/scope labels used by the repo (e.g., platform-specific or feature-specific labels).

### Label and Assignment DO / DON'T

- ✅ DO: Assign the PR to yourself as the author
- ✅ DO: Add a QA label for every PR
- ✅ DO: Add the correct team label for routing
- ✅ DO: Remove blocking labels when conditions are resolved
- ❌ DON'T: Leave PR unassigned
- ❌ DON'T: Merge while `needs-qa` or `DO-NOT-MERGE` is present

## 4. Branch Naming Conventions

Use descriptive branch names prefixed by the commit type.

- Format: `<type>/<short-kebab-description>`
- Examples:
  - `feat/add-nft-gallery`
  - `fix/wallet-connection-issue`
  - `chore/update-linting-config`
  - `refactor/tx-formatter-utils`

### Branch DO / DON'T

- ✅ DO: Keep names short, lowercase, and kebab-cased
- ✅ DO: Use a type that matches your PR title prefix
- ❌ DON'T: Use ambiguous or personal names like `dev/john` or `work-in-progress`

## 5. PR Best Practices

- Submit PRs as Draft initially to allow CI to run and gather early feedback.
- Only mark "Ready for review" after:
  - The PR is assigned to yourself (the author)
  - The PR template is fully completed
  - Lint, unit tests, and type-checks pass
  - Required screenshots/recordings are attached
  - Required labels are applied
- Target the `main` branch unless otherwise required by release process.
- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix; avoid mixing refactors with functional changes.
- Include tests when applicable (unit, integration, or e2e) and update snapshots as needed.
- Add or update JSDoc for public functions/types when relevant.

### DO / DON'T Summary

- ✅ DO: Assign the PR to yourself immediately after creation
- ✅ DO: Keep the diff small and focused
- ✅ DO: Include reproducible manual testing steps
- ✅ DO: Update documentation and changelog entries
- ✅ DO: Request review from the correct team
- ❌ DON'T: Leave the PR unassigned
- ❌ DON'T: Skip template sections
- ❌ DON'T: Merge with failing checks or missing QA validation when required
- ❌ DON'T: Push unrelated formatting or drive-by changes

## Examples for MetaMask Mobile Context

- Title: `feat: add NFT gallery to collectibles tab`
- Branch: `feat/add-nft-gallery`
- Assignee: The PR author (yourself)
- Labels: `team-mobile-ux`, `needs-qa`, `Run E2E Smoke`
- Changelog: `Added NFT gallery to Collectibles tab.`
- Manual testing (Gherkin): see example above

## Enforcement

- PRs must use `.github/pull-request-template.md` with all sections completed.
- PRs must be assigned to their author immediately after creation.
- Titles must follow Conventional Commits.
- Missing or incorrect labels that block merging must be resolved before merge.
- PRs that do not follow these rules should be converted back to Draft with a comment referencing this rule.
- Automated checks should fail PRs that are missing required sections, assignment, or labels when possible.

## Component-view Testing (Project-wide)

Follow these rules for all component-view tests. Nested, component-specific rules may also apply.

- **Mock policy**
  - Only mock `../../../core/Engine`, `../../../core/Engine/Engine`, and `react-native-device-info`.
  - No mocking of hooks or selectors; drive behavior via Redux state.
  - Enforced by runtime guard in `app/util/test/testSetup.js` and ESLint override in `.eslintrc.js`.

- **Framework usage (REQUIRED)**
  - Use presets: `initialStateBridge`, `initialStateWallet`.
  - Use renderers: `renderBridgeView`, `renderWalletView`.
  - Use `stateFixture.ts` helpers for overrides (e.g., quotes, feature flags).
  - Prefer `deterministicFiat: true` for exact fiat assertions.

- **Navigation tests**
  - Use `renderScreenWithRoutes` and build `state` via the preset + minimal overrides.
  - Assert using route names from `app/constants/navigation/Routes.ts`.

- **Test structure**
  - AAA pattern with blank lines between sections.
  - Action-oriented names (no “should”).
  - One behavior per test; robust assertions over brittle formatting.

- **Execution**
  - Prefer `--coverage=false` during iteration for speed.
  - Use yarn only (no npm/npx).

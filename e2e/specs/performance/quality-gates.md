# üéØ Performance Quality Gates

This document outlines the performance thresholds (quality gates) for MetaMask Mobile's critical user flows. These thresholds ensure optimal user experience across different platforms and scenarios.

## üì± Platform Overview

- **Android**: Generally has higher thresholds due to platform constraints
- **iOS**: Lower thresholds leveraging platform optimizations
- **Quality Gates**: Hard limits that cause test failures if exceeded

## üìä Test Reporting

Performance tests automatically generate detailed reports using the `PerformanceTestReporter` utility:
- **JSON Reports**: Structured performance data for analysis
- **Test Results**: Include timing metrics, thresholds, and pass/fail status
- **User Profile Testing**: Tests run across different user states (CORE_USER, POWER_USER)

| **iOS** | 5000ms | 5 seconds maximum |

---

### Test: `handle account list performance with heavy token load`
**Configuration**: Multiple accounts, popular networks, 10 tokens for stress testing

| Platform | Total Max Time | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| **Android** | 5000ms | 5 seconds maximum |
| **iOS** | 5000ms | 5 seconds maximum |

## üö® Quality Gate Rules

### Failure Criteria
Tests fail immediately when total time exceeds the maximum acceptable time for any scenario.

### Performance Patterns
- **Heavy Token Load**: Increases render times but maintains same thresholds as standard load
- **Platform Differences**: iOS consistently performs better than Android
- **Baseline Tests**: Should complete quickly but have generous thresholds for stability
- **Dismissal Tests**: Focus on UI responsiveness during state transitions

### User Profile Testing
Tests run across different user states with varying account complexity:

#### User Profile Definitions
- **CASUAL_USER**: 2 EVM accounts from 1 SRP *(currently not used in tests)*
- **CORE_USER**: 5 EVM accounts and 5 Solana accounts from 1 SRP
- **POWER_USER**: 15 EVM accounts from 2 SRPs + 5 Solana accounts

#### Current Test Coverage
- **CORE_USER**: Standard user configuration for baseline performance
- **POWER_USER**: Enhanced user configuration with maximum account complexity

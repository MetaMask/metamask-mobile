GOAL: Analyze code changes and select appropriate smoke test tags to run.

AVAILABLE TAGS:
${availableTags.map(tag => `- ${tag}`).join('\n')}

TAG COVERAGE:
${tagCoverageLines}

TOOLS AVAILABLE:
- read_file: Read actual file content
- get_git_diff: See exact code changes
- get_pr_diff: Get full PR diff (for live PRs)
- find_related_files: Discover impact depth and relationships
  * For CI files: finds reusable workflow callers, GitHub Action usage, script usage in workflows
  * For code files: finds importers (dependents), dependencies, tests, module files
  * Use search_type='ci' for workflow/action/script relationships
  * Use search_type='importers' to find who depends on code changes
  * Use search_type='all' for comprehensive relationship analysis
- finalize_decision: Submit your selection

REASONING APPROACH:
You have extended thinking enabled (10,000 tokens). Use it to:
- Think deeply about change impacts
- Consider direct and indirect effects
- Reason about risk levels
- Map changes to test coverage

WORKFLOW:
1. Review the changed files
2. For critical files (Engine, controllers, core), examine actual changes
3. For critical changes or CI files, use find_related_files to understand impact depth:
   - CI files: Use search_type='ci' to find workflow callers and script usage
   - Core code: Use search_type='importers' to find dependents
   - When unsure about impact: Use search_type='all' for comprehensive view
4. Use get_git_diff to see specific modifications if needed
5. Think about what functionality is affected
6. Select appropriate tags
7. Call finalize_decision with your analysis

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Low: Pure documentation, README, comments
- Medium: UI changes, new components, utilities
- High: Core modules, controllers, Engine
- Critical: Dependencies, critical paths, security
- Still consider tests for low/medium changes if they affect user flows or testing infrastructure

SPECIAL CASES:
- CI/CD changes (workflows, actions, scripts): ALWAYS investigate deeply
  * For GitHub Actions (.github/actions/):
    Use find_related_files with search_type='ci' to find workflows using the action
    If used in test workflows → consider running affected test tags
    Changes to action logic may affect multiple workflows
  * For reusable workflows (.github/workflows with workflow_call):
    Use find_related_files with search_type='ci' to find all callers
    If widely used (>5 callers) → HIGH RISK → run comprehensive tests
  * For scripts (scripts/, .github/scripts/):
    Use find_related_files to find all workflows using the script
    If used in test/build workflows → consider running affected test tags
  * For workflow changes: Read the diff to understand what's being modified
    If test execution logic changes → HIGH RISK
- Test file changes: Usually safe, but examine what's being tested
- Config changes: May affect runtime behavior, investigate carefully

SELECTION GUIDANCE:
- Use your judgment on whether tests are needed - 0 tags is perfectly acceptable for genuine non-functional changes
- Critical files (package.json, controllers, Engine) should almost always trigger tests
- Reading actual diffs (get_git_diff) provides better context than filenames alone
- For CI files: Use find_related_files first, then assess impact breadth and depth
- If a reusable workflow or widely-used script changes → likely HIGH impact so consider running tests
- Err on the side of caution when uncertain and make some selection rather than none (unless clearly non-functional)
- Changes to controllers and Engine are high risk and usually warrant tests

CONFIDENCE SCORING (0-100):
- 90-100%: Very confident (clear-cut cases)
  * Pure docs/README changes → 0 tags
  * Single test file change with no functional impact
  * Obvious critical changes requiring full coverage
- 70-89%: Confident (normal cases)
  * Standard code changes with clear impact assessment
  * Used tools to investigate and have good understanding
- 50-69%: Moderate confidence (some uncertainty)
  * Complex changes with unclear boundaries
  * Couldn't fully investigate all dependencies
- 0-49%: Low confidence (significant uncertainty)
  * Large refactors with unknown impact
  * Insufficient information to assess properly
  * When in doubt, err on side of running more tests

Be thorough but efficient. Use your judgment.

When confident in your decision, use finalize_decision to complete.`;

# This test requires the app to be manually launched first with port forwarding
# Run:
#   adb reverse tcp:12345 tcp:12345
#   adb shell pm clear io.metamask && adb shell am start -n io.metamask/.MainActivity
# Then run: maestro test e2e/maestro/tests/fixtures-onboarding.yaml

- runFlow: ../pages/loadElements.yaml

# Unlock the wallet (fixtures loaded, so we have a wallet that needs unlocking)
- runFlow: ../subflows/unlock-wallet.yaml

# Assert we're on home screen (fixtures loaded successfully and unlocked!)
- assertVisible: 'Account 1'
# SUCCESS! Fixtures bypassed onboarding and wallet is unlocked!

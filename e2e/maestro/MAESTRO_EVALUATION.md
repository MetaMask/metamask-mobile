## Pros vs. Cons of Maestro with MetaMask {#pros-vs-cons}

### ‚úÖ Pros

#### 1. **Dramatically Faster Test Development**

- **YAML-based syntax** is significantly more concise than TypeScript/JavaScript
- Tests that take 100+ lines in Detox can be written in 30-40 lines in Maestro
- No compilation step required - edit and run immediately
- Example: Our POC import SRP test is ~109 lines in Maestro vs. ~150+ lines in equivalent Detox test (including page objects)

#### 2. **Superior Developer Experience**

- **Maestro Studio**: Real-time visual test execution and debugging
  - See exactly what the test is doing at each step
  - Pause execution and interact with the app
  - No need to run full test suite to debug a single step
- **Instant feedback loop**: Edit YAML ‚Üí Run test (no build/compile)
- **Easier onboarding**: QA engineers and developers can write tests faster

#### 3. **Better Maintainability**

- Declarative syntax is easier to read and understand
- Less boilerplate code
- Clearer test intent - tests read like documentation
- Changes to UI don't require TypeScript recompilation

#### 4. **Cross-Platform by Design**

- Same test syntax works for iOS and Android
- Platform-specific adjustments handled via conditional logic when needed
- Reduces duplication of test logic across platforms

#### 5. **Successful Integration with Existing Infrastructure**

- ‚úÖ **Fixtures**: Seamlessly reuses existing `FixtureBuilder` and `FixtureServer`
- ‚úÖ **Mocks**: Successfully implemented Mockttp-based API mocking
- ‚úÖ **Page Objects**: Adapted POM pattern to Maestro's paradigm
- Zero code duplication with Detox infrastructure

#### 6. **Active Development and Community**

- Maestro is actively maintained and regularly updated
- Growing community and ecosystem
- Responsive support from maintainers
- Used by major companies (Shopify, Coinbase, etc.)

#### 7. **Better Error Messages and Debugging**

- Clear, human-readable error messages
- Screenshots and logs automatically captured on failure
- Easier to identify what went wrong and where

#### 8. **Faster Test Execution** (Potential)

- Maestro tests generally execute faster than Detox
- Less overhead from test framework itself
- Would need performance testing to quantify for MetaMask

#### 9. **Lower Learning Curve**

- Non-developers (QA, Product) can write and maintain tests
- YAML is more accessible than TypeScript
- Reduces bottleneck of engineering resources for test development

### ‚ùå Cons

#### 1. **Migration Effort**

- Existing 200+ Detox tests would need to be migrated or maintained in parallel
- Initial investment required to convert tests
- **Mitigation**: Can adopt incrementally - new tests in Maestro, critical tests migrated gradually

#### 2. **Less Type Safety**

- YAML doesn't provide compile-time type checking
- Selector errors caught at runtime, not at write-time
- **Mitigation**: Good page object organization and testing practices can minimize this

#### 3. **Limited Complex Logic Support**

- Maestro excels at UI flows but complex conditional logic is harder
- Some advanced scenarios may still require helper scripts
- **Mitigation**: Can use JavaScript helper scripts for complex logic (as we did with fixture-loader.js)

#### 4. **Ecosystem Maturity**

- Smaller ecosystem compared to established tools like Detox/Appium
- Fewer third-party integrations (though growing)
- **Mitigation**: Core integrations (GitHub Actions, BrowserStack) are available

#### 5. **CI/CD Integration Unknowns**

- Need to validate performance in CI environments
- Need to verify BrowserStack integration works smoothly
- **Mitigation**: These are evaluation items, not blockers

#### 6. **Team Familiarity**

- Current team is experienced with Detox
- Learning curve for Maestro (though lower than Detox)
- **Mitigation**: Maestro's simplicity means faster ramp-up

#### 7. **Platform-Specific Testing**

- Some platform-specific behaviors may require workarounds
- Not as granular control as native Detox APIs
- **Mitigation**: Maestro provides escape hatches (runScript) for platform-specific needs

#### 8. **Debugging Complex Failures**

- For very complex test failures, may need to drop into native debugging
- Less visibility into app internals compared to Detox
- **Mitigation**: Maestro Studio provides excellent visual debugging for most cases

## Implementation Successes {#implementation-successes}

Our POC successfully demonstrated that Maestro can integrate with MetaMask's existing E2E infrastructure without compromising functionality.

### ‚úÖ Page Object Model (POM) Pattern

**Challenge**: Adapt MetaMask's existing Page Object Model pattern to Maestro's YAML-based approach.

**Solution**: Hybrid approach using JavaScript page object files loaded dynamically.

**Implementation**:

```yaml
# Load page objects at start of test
- runFlow: ../pages/loadElements.yaml

# Use page objects in tests
- tapOn:
    id: ${output.login.passwordInput}
- inputText: '123123123'
- tapOn:
    id: ${output.login.unlockButton}
```

**Results**:

- ‚úÖ Clean separation of selectors and test logic
- ‚úÖ Reusable across all Maestro tests
- ‚úÖ Easy to maintain - update selector once, affects all tests
- ‚úÖ Similar structure to Detox page objects

**Files Created**:

- `e2e/maestro/pages/onboarding.js`
- `e2e/maestro/pages/login.js`
- `e2e/maestro/pages/home.js`
- `e2e/maestro/pages/add-wallet.js`
- `e2e/maestro/pages/browser.js`
- `e2e/maestro/pages/multichain-test-dapp.js`

**Lessons Learned**:

- JavaScript page objects work seamlessly with Maestro
- Global `output` variable pattern is effective
- Page objects can be loaded once and reused throughout test
- No loss of functionality compared to Detox POM

---

### ‚úÖ Fixture Support

**Challenge**: Reuse MetaMask's existing fixture infrastructure to bypass onboarding and set up test prerequisites.

**Solution**: Node.js script that starts `FixtureServer` and serves pre-built fixture states.

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Start fixture server with specific fixture
node e2e/maestro/scripts/fixture-loader.js --action start --fixture import-srp

# Fixture server runs on port 12345 (matches Detox)
# App automatically loads fixture on launch via E2E build
```

**Key Features**:

- ‚úÖ **Zero Code Duplication**: Reuses existing `FixtureBuilder` and `FixtureServer` from Detox framework
- ‚úÖ **All Fixtures Available**: Supports all existing fixture configurations
- ‚úÖ **Same Port**: Uses port 12345 to match Detox configuration
- ‚úÖ **Compatible with E2E Build**: No app changes required

**Available Fixtures** (examples):

- `default` - Basic post-onboarding state
- `import-srp` - Wallet with multiple accounts
- `with-tokens` - Wallet with ERC20 tokens
- `account-with-nfts` - Wallet with NFT collections
- `network-custom` - Custom network configurations
- _...and 25+ more_

**Integration**:

```yaml
# In Maestro test - unlock wallet after fixture loads
- runFlow: ../subflows/unlock-wallet.yaml

# Now test starts with pre-configured state
- tapOn:
    id: account-picker
```

**Results**:

- ‚úÖ Successfully loaded complex wallet states
- ‚úÖ Tests start 10-15 seconds faster (no onboarding UI)
- ‚úÖ More reliable tests (no UI flakiness from onboarding)
- ‚úÖ Same fixture behavior as Detox tests

**Lessons Learned**:

- Fixture infrastructure is framework-agnostic
- Reusing existing code reduces maintenance burden
- Fixture approach is superior to UI-based setup

---

### ‚úÖ API Mocking

**Challenge**: Mock external API calls (feature flags, account APIs, etc.) to control test behavior and avoid flakiness.

**Solution**: Mockttp-based proxy server that intercepts HTTP requests and returns mocked responses.

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Start mock server with specific preset
node e2e/maestro/scripts/mock-server.js --action start --preset feature-flags

# Mock server runs on port 8000 (matches Detox)
# App routes requests through /proxy endpoint
```

**Architecture**:

```
MetaMask App (E2E Build)
    ‚Üì
    | HTTP Request to external API
    ‚Üì
E2E App Proxy Logic
    ‚Üì
    | Proxies to http://localhost:8000/proxy?url=...
    ‚Üì
Mock Server (Mockttp)
    ‚Üì
    | If URL matches mock: return mock response
    | Else: pass through to real API
    ‚Üì
Real API or Mock Response
```

**Key Implementation Details**:

1. **Health Check Endpoint**:

   ```javascript
   // E2E app checks this to detect mock server
   await mockServer.forGet('/health-check').thenReply(200, 'OK');
   ```

2. **Proxy Endpoint**:

   ```javascript
   // Intercepts all app requests
   await mockServer
     .forAnyRequest()
     .matching((request) => request.path.startsWith('/proxy'))
     .thenCallback(async (request) => {
       // Extract target URL from query param
       const targetUrl = new URL(request.url).searchParams.get('url');

       // Check if we should mock this request
       if (targetUrl.includes('client-config.api.cx.metamask.io/v1/flags')) {
         return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify(mockFeatureFlags) };
       }

       // Pass through to real API
       return await fetch(targetUrl);
     });
   ```

3. **Feature Flag Mocking**:
   ```javascript
   const featureFlagMocks = {
     enableMultichainAccountsState2: {
       enabled: true,
       featureVersion: '2',
       minimumVersion: '7.46.0',
     },
   };
   ```

**Mock Presets**:

- `feature-flags` - Mock remote feature flags
- `default` - Basic mocks for standard tests
- _Extensible for more presets_

**Results**:

- ‚úÖ Successfully mocked feature flag API responses
- ‚úÖ Tests behave identically to Detox mocked tests
- ‚úÖ No test flakiness from network conditions
- ‚úÖ Can test feature flag variations without app changes

**Integration with Fixtures**:

```bash
# Run test with both fixtures and mocks
./e2e/maestro/scripts/run-test-with-servers.sh \
  e2e/maestro/tests/add-wallet-with-mocks.yaml \
  import-srp \
  feature-flags
```

**Mock Server Logs** (from successful test run):

```
‚úÖ Mock server started successfully!
[Mock Server] Proxy request for: https://client-config.api.cx.metamask.io/v1/flags?...
[Mock Server] ‚úÖ Returning mocked feature flags
[Mock Server] Proxy request for: https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/...
[Mock Server] ‚Üí Pass-through to real server
```

**Lessons Learned**:

- Mockttp works excellently with Maestro
- Proxy-based mocking is flexible and powerful
- Same mocking approach as Detox ensures consistency
- Pass-through for unmocked requests prevents test brittleness

### üéØ POC Test: Import SRP with Fixtures + Mocks

**Test**: `e2e/maestro/tests/add-wallet-with-mocks.yaml`

**Equivalent Detox Test**: `e2e/specs/accounts/import-srp.spec.ts`

**What It Tests**:

1. Loads fixture with existing wallet (bypasses onboarding)
2. Unlocks wallet with fixture password
3. Opens account picker
4. Taps "Add account" ‚Üí "Import SRP"
5. Enters 12-word seed phrase
6. Taps "Continue" to import
7. Verifies new account "Account 1" is created
8. Uses mocked feature flags throughout

**Test Code** (simplified excerpt):

```yaml
appId: io.metamask
---
# Load page objects
- runFlow: ../pages/loadElements.yaml

# Unlock wallet (fixtures loaded)
- runFlow: ../subflows/unlock-wallet.yaml

# Open account picker
- tapOn:
    id: account-picker

# Add account ‚Üí Import SRP
- tapOn:
    id: account-list-add-account-button
- tapOn:
    id: add-account-srp-account

# Enter seed phrase (12 words)
- tapOn:
    id: srp-input-word-1
- inputText: 'spread'
# ... (11 more words)

# Import
- doubleTapOn: 'Continue'

# Verify success
- extendedWaitUntil:
    visible:
      id: account-label
    timeout: 20000
- assertVisible:
    text: 'Account 1'
```

**Results**:

- ‚úÖ **Test passes successfully** on Android emulator
- ‚úÖ **Fixtures loaded correctly** - wallet state pre-configured
- ‚úÖ **Mocks working** - feature flags intercepted and returned
- ‚úÖ **108 lines total** (vs. ~150+ for equivalent Detox test)
- ‚úÖ **Execution time**: ~45 seconds (comparable to Detox)

**Running the Test**:

```bash
./e2e/maestro/scripts/run-test-with-servers.sh \
  e2e/maestro/tests/add-wallet-with-mocks.yaml \
  import-srp \
  feature-flags
```

**Output**:

```
üîß Running test with servers
   Test: e2e/maestro/tests/add-wallet-with-mocks.yaml
   Fixture: import-srp
   Mock preset: feature-flags

‚úÖ Fixture server running (port 12345)
‚úÖ Mock server running (port 8000)
‚úÖ Port forwarding configured
‚úÖ App data cleared
‚úÖ App launched

üß™ Running test...

- **Infrastructure**: BrowserStack credits, CI runner time (~$2-3K)
- **Total Estimated Cost**: ~$50-75K (engineering time)

### Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: Maestro doesn't meet performance requirements
  - **Mitigation**: Evaluation phases identify issues early; can stop before full commitment
- **Risk**: Team doesn't adopt Maestro effectively
  - **Mitigation**: Training and pilot program build confidence
- **Risk**: Migration takes longer than expected
  - **Mitigation**: Phased approach allows parallel operation of both frameworks

## Vision: Maestro as Primary Testing Framework {#future-vision}

### What Success Looks Like

Imagine a world where MetaMask Mobile uses Maestro as its primary E2E testing framework:

#### üìù Test Development

**Today (Detox)**:

```typescript
// 1. Open IDE, create TypeScript file
// 2. Import dependencies (10+ lines)
// 3. Define page objects (20-30 lines per page)
// 4. Write test logic (50-100 lines)
// 5. Compile TypeScript
// 6. Run test
// 7. Debug with logs and element inspection
// Total: 30-45 minutes for medium test
```

**Future (Maestro)**:

```yaml
# 1. Open text editor, create YAML file
# 2. Import page objects (1 line)
# 3. Write test flow (15-30 lines)
# 4. Run test immediately
# 5. Debug with Maestro Studio (visual)
# Total: 10-15 minutes for medium test
```

**Impact**: 2-3x faster test development

---

#### üêõ Test Debugging

**Today (Detox)**:

1. Test fails with stack trace
2. Add console.logs or breakpoints
3. Rebuild TypeScript
4. Re-run test
5. Inspect logs to find issue
6. Fix and repeat
7. Total time: 15-30 minutes per debug cycle

**Future (Maestro)**:

1. Test fails with clear error message
2. Open Maestro Studio
3. See visual timeline of test execution
4. Identify exact step that failed
5. See screenshot of app at failure point
6. Fix YAML and re-run (no compilation)
7. Total time: 5-10 minutes per debug cycle

**Impact**: 50-60% faster debugging

---

#### üîÑ Test Maintenance

**Scenario**: UI element ID changes from `account-button` to `account-picker`

**Today (Detox)**:

1. Find all references in TypeScript files
2. Update page object selectors
3. Update any inline selectors
4. Recompile TypeScript
5. Run affected tests to verify
6. Total: 10-20 minutes

**Future (Maestro)**:

1. Update page object JavaScript file
2. Run tests immediately (no compilation)
3. Total: 2-5 minutes

**Impact**: 75% faster maintenance

---

#### üë• Team Collaboration

**Today (Detox)**:

- Only engineers with TypeScript knowledge can write tests
- QA team needs engineering support for test development
- Product team can't easily read/understand test logic
- New engineers need weeks to become productive

**Future (Maestro)**:

- QA engineers write tests independently
- Product team can read and validate test scenarios
- Engineers focus on complex logic, not boilerplate
- New team members productive in days, not weeks

**Impact**: 3-5x increase in test authoring capacity

---

#### üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

**Today (Detox)**:

```
1. Build app (10-15 min)
2. Build tests (5 min)
3. Run tests (45-60 min)
Total: ~70 minutes
```

**Future (Maestro)**:

```
1. Build app (10-15 min)
2. Run tests (30-40 min) [parallel execution]
Total: ~45-55 minutes
```

**Impact**: 25-35% faster CI/CD pipeline

---

#### üìä Test Coverage Growth

**Current State**:

- ~200 Detox tests
- Coverage gaps due to high test development cost
- Slow growth rate (5-10 tests/month)

**Future State**:

- 500+ Maestro tests (within 12 months)
- Faster coverage of new features
- Growth rate: 20-30 tests/month
- QA team can write tests without engineering bottleneck

**Impact**: 2-3x faster coverage growth

### Final Thought

The E2E testing landscape is evolving. Maestro represents the next generation of mobile testing tools‚Äîfaster, simpler, and more maintainable than previous frameworks.

**This is an opportunity to lead**, not follow. By adopting Maestro now, MetaMask can:

- Build a best-in-class E2E test suite
- Set the standard for mobile testing in Web3
- Attract top QA and engineering talent
- Ship features faster with higher confidence

The question is not "Can we afford to adopt Maestro?" but rather **"Can we afford not to?"**

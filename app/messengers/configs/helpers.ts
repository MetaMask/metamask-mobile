 * Helper function to define the excluded capabilities for a messenger. This is

 *
 * @param capabilities - The capabilities to exclude, which must be valid action
 * and event types for the `RootMessenger`.
 * @param capabilities.actions - The action types to exclude, which must be
 * valid action types for the `RootMessenger`.
 * @param capabilities.events - The event types to exclude, which must be valid
 * event types for the `RootMessenger`.
 * @returns The given capabilities, typed as the specific action and event types
 * that were excluded.

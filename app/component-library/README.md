# Component Library

This folder contains design system components that are built 1:1 with the Figma [DS Components](https://www.figma.com/file/HKpPKij9V3TpsyMV1TpV7C/DS-Components?node-id=16-6) UI kit and should be used where possible in all UI feature work.

If you are a designer you can visit the [MetaMask Design System Guides (Design)](https://www.notion.so/MetaMask-Design-System-Guides-Design-f86ecc914d6b4eb6873a122b83c12940?pvs=4).

## Storybook

We document our components using Storybook.

For instructions on how to run Storybook locally see our [Storybook documentation](../../docs/readme/storybook.md).

**Quick Start**: Modify `index.js` to uncomment the Storybook imports and comment out the regular app registration, then run the app as normal.

```
/* Uncomment and comment regular registration below */
// import Storybook from './.storybook';
// AppRegistry.registerComponent(name, () => Storybook);
```

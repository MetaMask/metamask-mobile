# Component Library

This folder contains design system components that are built 1:1 with the Figma [DS Components](https://www.figma.com/file/HKpPKij9V3TpsyMV1TpV7C/DS-Components?node-id=16-6) UI kit and should be used where possible in all UI feature work.

If you are a designer you can visit the [MetaMask Design System Guides (Design)](https://www.notion.so/MetaMask-Design-System-Guides-Design-f86ecc914d6b4eb6873a122b83c12940?pvs=4).

## Storybook

We document our components using Storybook. To run storybook run application as normal and [uncomment these lines in index.js](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/blob/main/index.js#L84-L86)

```
/* Uncomment and comment regular registration below */
// import Storybook from './.storybook';
// AppRegistry.registerComponent(name, () => Storybook);
```

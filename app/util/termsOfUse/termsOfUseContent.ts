THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION AND A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS AS DETAILED IN SECTION 11. PLEASE READ THE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.</p>\n<p>Consensys Software Inc. (“Consensys,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is the leading blockchain software development company. With a focus on utilizing decentralized technologies, such as Ethereum, our software is powering a revolution in commerce and finance and helping to optimize business processes. Consensys hosts a top level domain website, <!-- -->https://consensys.io/<!-- -->, that serves information regarding Consensys and our products and services (collectively, the “Offerings”), as well as sub-domains for our products or services (the top level domain with the sub-domains collectively referred to as the “Site”), which include text, images, audio, code and other materials or third party information.</p>\n<p>These Terms of Use, including their appendix (the “Terms,” “Terms of Use” or “Agreement”) contain the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Site and Offerings provided by us and is an agreement between us and you or the entity you represent (“you” or “your”). Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using the Site or Offerings. By using the Site, clicking a button or checkbox to accept or agree to these Terms where that option is made available, clicking a button to use or access any of the Offerings, completing an Order, or, if earlier, using or otherwise accessing the Offerings (the date on which any of the events listed above occur being the “Effective Date”), you (1) accept and agree to these Terms and any additional terms that apply to certain Additional Offerings (as defined below), rules and conditions of participation issued by Consensys from time to time and (2) consent to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of information as described in our <!-- -->Privacy Notice<!-- -->. If you do not agree to the Terms or perform any and all obligations you accept under the Terms, then you may not access or use the Offerings.</p>\n<p>You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts. If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 13 for definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement.</p>\n<p>In addition, you represent to us that you are (1) not subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties, including but not limited to the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. Government (i.e., the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List of the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Entity List of the U.S. Department of Commerce), the European Union or its Member States, the United Kingdom, or other applicable government authority and (2) not located in any country subject to a comprehensive sanctions program implemented by the United States.</p>\n<h3>1. The Offerings.</h3>\n<p>1.1 Generally. You may access and use the Offerings only in accordance with this Agreement. You agree to comply with the terms of this Agreement and all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the Offerings.</p>\n<p>1.2 Offerings and Access. Consensys offers a number of Offerings under the Consensys brand or brands owned by us. These include Infura, MetaMask and others. Offerings are generally accessed through the Site or through a third party provider of which we approved, such as the Google Play or Apple App stores, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Some Offerings may require you to create an account with Consensys, enter a valid form of payment, and select a paid plan (a “Paid Plan”), or initiate an Order.</p>\n<p>1.3 Third-Party Content and Services. In certain Offerings, including MetaMask Swaps, Bridging, Staking, and Snaps, you may view, have access to, and may use the informational content, products, or services of one or more third parties (“Third Party Content” and “Third Party Services” respectively). In each such case, you agree that you view, access or use such content and services at your own election. Your reliance on any Third Party Content and use of Third Party Services in connection with the Offerings is governed on one hand by this Agreement but, on the other, will also generally be subject to separate terms and conditions set forth by the applicable third party content and/or service provider. Those terms and conditions may involve separate fees and charges or may include disclaimers or risk warnings about reliance on or the accuracy of any information. Such terms may also apply a privacy policy different than that which Consensys maintains and incorporates into this Agreement. It is your responsibility to understand the terms and conditions of Third Party Services, including how those service providers use any of your information under their privacy policies.</p>\n<p>Third Party Content and Third Party Services are provided for your convenience only. We do not verify, curate, or control Third Party Content. We do not control Third Party Services. As a result, we do not guarantee, endorse, or recommend such content or services to any or all users of the Offerings, or the use of such content or services for any particular purpose. You access, rely upon or use any Third Party Content or Third Party Service at your own risk. Consensys disclaims all responsibility and liability for any Losses on account of your reliance upon or use of such content or services. We have no responsibility for Third Party Content that may be misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable to you or under the law in your jurisdiction. The choice to rely on Third Party Content or to use a Third Party Service is your own, and you are solely responsible for ensuring that your reliance or use is in compliance with all applicable laws. Dealing or correspondence with any third party that provides such content or services is solely between you and that third party. We reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, disable, or impose access restrictions or limits on the use of any Third Party Service at any time without notice.</p>\n<p>1.4  Support. You may seek or receive technical or product support, information, advice, or guidance from us regarding the Offerings, including via third party service provider, chat interface, or email. All support made available or provided by or on behalf of Consensys is believed to be reliable, but we do not make representations or warranties, express or implied, as to its accuracy, its completeness, or the results to be obtained. Such support is being provided for informational purposes only and, by accepting such support, you are representing that you have adequate skill and experience regarding the proper selection, use, and/or application of Offerings and use such Offerings at your own discretion and risk. With the exception of instances of gross negligence, you hold us harmless for any injury that may result from the support you receive from us.  You are aware that our customer support efforts may be impersonated by malicious third parties, and you agree that we are not responsible for the actions of such impersonators.  You further acknowledge that we will not offer support via SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, WeChat, or Twitter DMs, and that we will never ask you for your private key or secret recovery phrase or for you to make a payment to us.</p>\n<h3>2. Changes.</h3>\n<p>2.1 To the Offerings. We may change or discontinue any or all of the Offerings or change or remove functionality of any or all of the Offerings from time to time. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate to you any discontinuation of an Offering through the Site or public communication channels. If you are on a Paid Plan, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate to you any discontinuation of the Offering at least 30 days in advance of such discontinuation, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue supporting the Offering for up to three months after the discontinuation, except if doing so (a) would pose an information security or intellectual property issue, (b) is economically or technically burdensome, or (c) would create undue risk of us violating the law.</p>\n<p>2.2 To this Agreement. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement or any Policies at any time. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes, but we will also use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate any material changes to this Agreement through the Site, email (if you have an account), or public channels. You agree that your continued use of or access to the Offerings following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes, whether or not you were checking for changes or actually read the changes.</p>\n<h3>3. Your Responsibilities.</h3>\n<p>3.1 Use of the Offerings. For any Offerings, whether they require that you set up an account with Consensys (such as Diligence) or they do not (such as MetaMask), and except to the extent caused by our breach of this Agreement, (a) you are responsible for all activities that occur with respect to your use of the Offerings, regardless of whether the activities are authorized by you or undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including your contractors, agents or other End Users), and (b) we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to the Offerings or your account, including any access that occurred as a result of fraud, phishing, or other criminal activity perpetrated against you by third parties. You will ensure that your use of the Offerings does not violate any applicable law.</p>\n<p>3.2 Your Security and Backup. You are solely responsible for properly configuring and using the Offerings and otherwise taking appropriate action to secure, protect, and backup your accounts and/or Your Content in a manner that will provide appropriate security and protection, which might include use of encryption. If you are not able to be responsible for your own account security, or do not want such an obligation, then you should not use the Offerings. Your obligations under this Agreement include ensuring any available software updates or upgrades to an Offering you are using are promptly installed or implemented, and recording and securely maintaining any passwords or secret recovery phrases that relate to your use of the Offerings. You acknowledge that certain methods of securing your secret recovery phrase, such as storing it as a digital file anywhere, including on your personal device or on a cloud storage provider, increase the risk that your account or secret recovery phrase will be compromised. You further acknowledge that you will not share with us nor any other third party any password or secret recovery phrase that relates to your use of the Offerings, and that we will not be held responsible if you do share any such password or phrase, whether you do so knowingly or unknowingly. For the avoidance of doubt, we take no responsibility whatsoever for any theft of a secret recovery phrase that involved intrusion through any means into your personal device or a cloud provider’s data repository.</p>\n<p>3.3 Log-In Credentials and API Authentication. To the extent we provide you with log-in credentials and API authentication generated by the Offerings, such log-in credentials and API authentication are for your use only and you will not sell, transfer, or sublicense them to any other entity or person, except that you may disclose your password or private key to your agents and subcontractors performing work on your behalf.</p>\n<p>3.4 Applicability to Offerings that facilitate access to addresses on blockchain protocols. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms of this Section 3 are applicable to all Offerings such as MetaMask through which you generate a public/private key pair (which can be thought of as a blockchain account and related password) either with a blockchain protocol directly or with Third Party Offerings, such as decentralized applications. You are solely responsible for the use and security of these security keys and that we will not be held responsible if you share any keys or secret recovery phrases with anyone else, whether knowingly or unknowingly.</p>\n<h3>4. Fees and Payment.</h3>\n<p>4.1 Publicly Available Offerings. Some Offerings may be offered to the public and licensed on a royalty free basis, including Offerings that require a Paid Plan for software licensing fees above a certain threshold of use. These terms apply to all Offerings regardless of whether they require a Paid Plan.</p>\n<p>4.2 Offering Fees. If your use of an Offering does not require an Order or Paid Plan but software licensing fees are charged contemporaneously with your use of the Offering, those fees will be charged as described on the Site or in the user interface of the Offering. Such fees may be calculated by combining a fee charged by us and a fee charged by a Third Party Offering that provides certain functionality related to the Offering. For those Offerings which entail an Order or Paid Plan, we calculate and bill fees and charges according to your Order or Paid Plan. For such Offerings, on the first day of each billing period, you will pay us the applicable fees (the “Base Fees”) and any applicable taxes based on the Offerings in the Paid Plan. In addition, for particular Orders, we may issue an invoice to you for all charges above the applicable threshold for your Paid Plan which constitute overage fees for the previous billing period. If you make any other changes to the Offerings during a billing period (for example, upgrading or downgrading your Paid Plan), we will apply any additional charges or credits to the next billing period. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued at our discretion upon notice to you. You will pay all fees in U.S. dollars unless the particular Offering specifies a different form of payment or otherwise agreed to by you and us in writing. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Offering or new feature of an Offering will be effective when we use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate updated fees and charges through our Site, the interface of the Offering itself, or other public channels or, if you are on a Paid Plan, upon commercially reasonable efforts to notify you directly, but we may expressly state when notifying you that another effective date applies. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Offerings you are using by using commercially reasonable efforts to notify users of the Offerings through our Site, the interface of the Offering itself, other public channels or, if you are on a Paid Plan, by giving you 30 days’ notice. Unless otherwise specified in an Order, all Paid Plan amounts due under this Agreement are payable within 30 days following receipt of your invoice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.</p>\n<p>4.3 Taxes. Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this Agreement. All fees payable by you are exclusive taxes unless otherwise noted. We reserve the right to withhold taxes where required.</p>\n<h3>5.

Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</h3>\n<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>\n<p>11.1 Binding Arbitration. Any dispute, claim or controversy (“Claim”) relating in any way to this Agreement, the Site, or your use of the Offerings will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this Section 11, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.</p>\n<p>11.1.1 If you are located in the United States: This agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or of the arbitrator’s award; any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a Texas state court located in Tarrant County, Texas. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement is void or voidable.  If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing we and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>11.1.2 If you are located in the United Kingdom: This agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales. Any dispute, claim or controversy relating in any way to this Agreement, the Offerings, your use of the Offerings, or to any products or services licensed or distributed by us will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this clause. Prior to commencing any formal arbitration proceedings, parties shall first seek settlement of any claim by mediation in accordance with the LCIA Mediation Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. If the dispute is not settled by mediation within 14 days of the commencement of the mediation, or such further period as the parties shall agree in writing, the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the LCIA Rules, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The language to be used in the mediation and in the arbitration shall be English. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be London.</p>\n<p>11.1.3 If you are located in any territory that is not specifically enumerated in Sections 11.1.1 or 11.1.2, you may elect for either of Section 11.1.1 or 11.1.2 to apply to you, otherwise this Agreement and any Claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of Ireland. Any Claim relating in any way to this Agreement, the Offerings, your use of the Offerings, or to any products or services licensed or distributed by us will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this clause. Prior to commencing any formal arbitration proceedings, parties shall first seek settlement of any claim by mediation in accordance with the LCIA Mediation Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. If the dispute is not settled by mediation within 14 days of the commencement of the mediation, or such further period as the parties shall agree in writing, the Claim shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the LCIA Rules, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The language to be used in the mediation and in the arbitration shall be English. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be Dublin, Ireland.</p>\n<p>11.2 Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS. Unless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>\n<p>11.3 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the email address <!-- --><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="204e4f544943455360434f4e53454e5359530e4e4554">[email&#160;protected]</a><!-- --> with subject line LEGAL OPT OUT. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Offerings, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes and will be deemed to have agreed to waive any right to pursue a class action in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these provisions, we will also not be bound by them.</p>\n<h3>12. Miscellaneous.</h3>\n<p>12.1 Assignment. You will not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of your rights and obligations under this Agreement, without our prior written consent.

The provisions for each Additional Offering below apply to your use of such Additional Offerings, supplementing the other applicable provisions of the Terms. If you do not use any Additional Offerings, then this Appendix does not apply to you.</p>\n<h3>1. Staking Services</h3>\n<p>When you hold Supported Digital Assets in your MetaMask wallet you may be given the option to license our software that you may use to “stake” on your own behalf these assets in a third party proof-of-stake (POS) network. Please visit our staking information page for further details on how proof of stake consensus mechanism works.</p>\n<p>1.1. General. Through MetaMask Staking, you can stake specific assets to receive rewards for securing Proof-of-Stake (POS) networks. You may choose to stake your assets by delegating to a Consensys-operated validator node or to a third-party validator node (both a “Designated Validator Node”). If you choose to stake your assets with a third-party validator node (including the “Lido Staked ETH” node or any other provider), then such staking is subject to the third party’s staking terms and conditions. CONSENSYS DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADVICE OR MAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT ENGAGING IN STAKING OR CHOOSING A VALIDATOR. Your choice to participate in staking and which method to do so are entirely your own.  Consensys reserves the right to modify the list of referenced validators at any time without prior notice.</p>\n<p>1.2. Staking Rewards and Fees. You understand and agree that the delegation of staking rights to a validator operator listed in Metamask does not grant to your benefit any right to request payment of any kind, but merely a potential right to share a reward perceived by the validator. If you stake your assets through MetaMask Staking, the Designated Validator Node will be acting as a transaction validator on the applicable Proof-of-Stake (POS) network. If the Designated Validator Node successfully validates a block of transactions in that network, you may receive staking rewards granted by such network and Consensys will receive a flat service fee (at the rate indicated either on the Site or in the user interface of the Offering). Your reward will be determined by the protocols of the applicable network. Please be aware that some Proof-of-Stake networks require that a certain amount of staked assets be “locked” (restricted from any use, sale or transfer) for a certain period of time while staking.</p>\n<p>1.3 No Custody. Consensys operates non-custodial services, including staking, meaning we do not have access to the security key that permits you to access the funds you have staked and any rewards you have earned.  We are not able to take custody of your rewards or assets. You acknowledge that you and not Consensys are responsible for safeguarding the security key that controls access to your staked tokens and your rewards.</p>\n<p>1.4 Disclaimer and Slashing. Staking is provided “as is”. Consensys is not responsible in any way for any failure by any supported blockchain network to transfer rewards (including any risks of “slashing”) or for the loss, destruction, or transfer of rewards to the incorrect wallet address. Consensys does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the staking services or that it will correct all defects or prevent third-party disruptions or unauthorized third party access.</p>\n<p>1.5 Suspension, Termination and Withdrawal. You may un-stake or stop using the services at any time. Depending on the protocol and the provider withdrawal processing queue, which Consensys does not control, the unstaking process may take hours or even days to complete. Any expected unstaking periods are estimates only. You may have to complete additional steps to claim your rewards depending on the third party service provider that is supporting the validators you chose to use. Consensys may suspend or terminate this staking offering for any reason in its sole discretion and is under no obligation to disclose the details of its decision to take such action with you, but if Consensys does so, Consensys will not itself inhibit access to your staked tokens or to any rewards you have earned, but we take no responsibility for any third party service provider or any third party protocol. In certain offerings, such as MetaMask Validator Staking, Consensys may be able to initiate the un-stake process to the wallet you staked with. Upon 90 days notice from Consensys of termination of the offering or suspension of your access, you must initiate and complete the un-stake process. After Upon expiration of that 90 day notice period, in its sole discretion, Consensys may initiate the un-stake process on your behalf and your staked tokens and any rewards issued by the third party protocol to the wallet you staked with and will not accessible by Consensys.</p>\n<p>1.6  No Guarantee of Rewards. CONSENSYS DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE STAKING REWARDS OR ANY STAKING REWARD RATES. SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE REWARDS IS SUBJECT TO THE PROOF-OF-STAKE NETWORKS AND IS NOT UNDER CONSENSYS’ CONTROL. REWARD RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE UNDERLYING PROTOCOLS AND NOT BY CONSENSYS AND MAY FLUCTUATE, INCLUDING BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING SERVICES GENERATING REWARDS ARE PERFORMED IMPROPERLY.</p>\n<h3>2.

## **Description**

This PR implements six major improvements to the Perps trading interface, delivered as a cohesive enhancement to the user experience:

### 1. **Perps Home Screen v2** (TAT-1538)

Replaced the previous market-only list view with a comprehensive trading dashboard that provides an at-a-glance overview of all relevant perps information:

- **Positions Carousel**: Horizontal scrollable list of open positions with quick access to position details
- **Orders Carousel**: Horizontal scrollable list of open limit orders with quick navigation
- **Trending Markets List**: Top 5 markets by 24h trading volume with "See all" navigation
- **Recent Activity List**: Last 3 trade executions with "See All" link to full activity tab
- **Learn More Component**: Educational component for new users (moved from individual market pages)

### 2. **Market Sorting & Filtering** (TAT-1539)

Added comprehensive market sorting capabilities accessible via the "See all" button from trending markets:

- **Sort Fields**: Volume, Price Change, Market Cap, Funding Rate, New Markets
- **Sort Direction**: Toggle between ascending/descending for each field
- **Search**: Real-time market search by symbol/name
- **Filter Chips**: Visual sort field selection using familiar chip pattern (similar to TP/SL presets)
- **Bottom Sheets**: Native iOS/Android bottom sheet selectors for sort field and direction

### 3. **Close All Positions** (TAT-1049)

Implemented batch position closing to streamline portfolio management:

- **Close All Button**: Visible on home screen when user has â‰¥2 open positions
- **Summary Bottom Sheet**: Displays aggregated margin, P&L, fees, and receive amount before confirmation
- **Shared Summary Component**: Extracted `PerpsCloseSummary` component used across single position close, close all modal, and close all view (eliminated 138 lines of duplicate JSX)
- **Batch Controller Method**: New `closePositions()` method in PerpsController with parallel execution and partial success handling
- **Enhanced Fee Hook**: Updated `usePerpsOrderFees` to accept single OR array params with automatic aggregation

### 4. **Cancel All Orders** (TAT-1815)

Implemented batch order cancellation following the same UX pattern as Close All Positions:

- **Cancel All Button**: Visible when user has multiple open orders
- **Confirmation Modal**: Simple confirmation dialog with order count
- **Batch Controller Method**: New `cancelOrders()` method in PerpsController with parallel execution
- **Consistent UX**: Follows same bottom sheet and confirmation pattern as Close All Positions

### 5. **Market Watchlist** (TAT-1252)

Added market watchlist functionality for quick access to preferred markets:

- **Watchlist Icon**: Star icon in market details header toggles watchlist status with immediate visual feedback
- **Persistent Storage**: Watchlist saved per network (testnet/mainnet) in controller state, survives app restarts
- **Activity Link Relocation**: Moved "Go to your activity" from header icon to Overview tab content for better UX
- **MetaMetrics Tracking**: Add to/remove from watchlist actions tracked with asset symbol and total watchlist count

### 6. **Saved Trade Configuration** (TAT-1231)

Implemented smart leverage defaults that remember user preferences per market:

- **Auto-Save on Order**: When user places an order, leverage is automatically saved for that market (per network)
- **Per-Market Memory**: Different assets remember different leverage (e.g., 6x for BTC, 10x for ETH, 3x for kPEPE)
- **Network-Specific**: Separate configurations for testnet and mainnet
- **Smart Priority**: Leverage selection follows: Navigation param > Existing position leverage (protocol constraint) > Saved config (user preference) > Default (3x)
- **Protocol Awareness**: Existing position logic unchanged - HyperLiquid still enforces new orders >= existing position leverage to prevent failures
- **Extensible Structure**: State structure allows future additions (e.g., size, TP/SL presets)

### Technical Improvements

- **No Breaking Changes**: Maintained all existing routes and component APIs
- **Component Reusability**: Shared `PerpsCloseSummary` eliminates code duplication across 3 close position UIs
- **Performance**: Parallel execution for batch operations with partial success handling
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript types for all new hooks, components, and controller methods
- **Consistent Patterns**: All hooks use object parameter pattern for extensibility

## **Manual testing steps**

```gherkin
Feature: Perps Home Screen v2

  Scenario: User views new home screen layout
    Given user is on Perps tab
    And user has at least 1 open position
    And user has at least 1 open order

    When user navigates to Perps home screen
    Then user sees positions carousel with position cards
    And user sees orders carousel with order cards
    And user sees trending markets list with top 5 markets
    And user sees recent activity list with last 3 trades
    And user sees "Learn more about perps" component

  Scenario: User navigates from home carousels
    Given user is on Perps home screen
    And positions carousel shows 3 positions
    And orders carousel shows 2 orders
    And trending markets shows 5 markets

    When user taps "View all" on positions carousel
    Then user is redirected to full positions list

    When user taps "View all" on orders carousel
    Then user is redirected to transactions view

    When user taps "See all" on trending markets
    Then user is redirected to market list view with sorting options

  Scenario: User sorts markets by different criteria
    Given user is on market list view (from "See all")
    And markets are displayed with default sort (Volume, descending)

    When user taps sort field dropdown
    Then user sees bottom sheet with options: Volume, Price Change, Market Cap, Funding Rate, New Markets

    When user selects "Price Change"
    And user taps sort direction toggle
    Then markets are sorted by price change in ascending order
    And sort chips reflect current selection

  Scenario: User searches for specific market
    Given user is on market list view
    And user sees search bar at top

    When user types "BTC" in search bar
    Then market list filters to show only BTC-related markets
    And search continues to work with active sort settings

  Scenario: User closes all positions at once
    Given user is on Perps home screen
    And user has 3 open positions
    And "Close All" button is visible

    When user taps "Close All" button
    Then bottom sheet appears showing:
      - Total margin (sum of all positions)
      - Total unrealized P&L (aggregated)
      - Total fees (closing fees for all positions)
      - Amount user will receive (margin + P&L - fees)
      - Estimated points (if rewards enabled)
      - Fee discount indicator (if applicable)

    When user taps "Close All" confirm button
    Then all 3 positions are closed at market price
    And success toast shows "Successfully closed 3 positions"
    And user is returned to home screen
    And positions carousel is empty or shows remaining positions

  Scenario: User closes all positions with partial failure
    Given user has 2 open positions
    And one position will fail to close (simulated network error)

    When user taps "Close All" and confirms
    Then 1 position closes successfully
    And 1 position fails to close
    And partial success toast shows "Successfully closed 1 of 2 positions"
    And failed position remains in positions carousel

  Scenario: User cancels all orders at once
    Given user is on Perps home screen
    And user has 4 open orders
    And "Cancel All" button is visible

    When user taps "Cancel All" button
    Then confirmation modal appears showing order count

    When user taps "Cancel All" confirm button
    Then all 4 orders are cancelled
    And success toast shows "Successfully cancelled 4 orders"
    And orders carousel is empty or shows remaining orders

  Scenario: User closes single position using shared summary component
    Given user is on single position close view
    And position has $1000 margin and +$150 P&L

    When user views the summary section
    Then user sees identical layout and formatting as close all summary:
      - Margin: $1,150 (includes P&L: +$150)
      - Fees: -$5.75 (with discount indicator if applicable)
      - You'll receive: $1,144.25
      - Estimated points (if rewards enabled)

    When user taps info icons
    Then same tooltips appear as in close all flow

  Scenario: User accesses learn more content
    Given user is on Perps home screen
    And "Learn more about perps" component is visible at bottom

    When user taps "Learn More" button
    Then external browser opens to MetaMask perps educational content

  Scenario: User's leverage preference is saved per market
    Given user has never traded BTC before
    And user has never traded ETH before
    And user is on trade order view for BTC

    When user selects leverage 6x
    And user places order successfully
    Then leverage 6x is saved for BTC on current network

    When user navigates to ETH trade order view
    Then leverage defaults to 3x (not 6x from BTC)

    When user selects leverage 10x for ETH
    And user places order successfully
    Then leverage 10x is saved for ETH on current network

    When user closes app and reopens
    And user navigates to BTC trade order view
    Then leverage pre-selects to 6x (saved preference)

    When user navigates to ETH trade order view
    Then leverage pre-selects to 10x (saved preference)

  Scenario: Saved leverage works across networks independently
    Given user is on testnet
    And user has saved leverage 5x for BTC on testnet

    When user places BTC order at 5x
    And user switches to mainnet
    And user navigates to BTC trade order view
    Then leverage defaults to 3x (mainnet has no saved config yet)

    When user places BTC order at 8x on mainnet
    And user switches back to testnet
    And user navigates to BTC trade order view
    Then leverage pre-selects to 5x (testnet config unchanged)

  Scenario: Existing position leverage takes priority over saved preference
    Given user has saved leverage 3x for BTC
    And user has open BTC position with leverage 10x
    And user navigates to BTC trade order view

    When order form loads
    Then leverage is set to 10x (existing position, not saved 3x)
    And this prevents order failure due to protocol constraint

  Scenario: Navigation param has highest priority for leverage
    Given user has saved leverage 6x for ETH
    And user has no open ETH position
    And user navigates to ETH order view with leverage=12 in params

    When order form loads
    Then leverage is set to 12x (navigation param)
    And saved preference 6x is not applied

  Scenario: Leverage priority chain validation
    Given user has saved leverage 5x for BTC
    And user has open BTC position with leverage 8x
    And user taps "Add to position" from position details (no nav param)

    When order form loads
    Then leverage is 8x (existing position wins over saved config)

    Given user has saved leverage 5x for ETH
    And user has no open ETH position
    And user navigates to ETH order view normally

    When order form loads
    Then leverage is 5x (saved config wins over default)

    Given user has never traded kPEPE
    And user has no open kPEPE position
    And user navigates to kPEPE order view

    When order form loads
    Then leverage is 3x (default fallback)
```

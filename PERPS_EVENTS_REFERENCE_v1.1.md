### Critical Missing Implementations

#### High Priority (User Journey Critical)

1. **Account Funding Flow** (Confirmation team)

   - All deposit transaction events missing
   - Blocks funding behavior analysis

2. **Risk Management Events**

   - No TP/SL setting/execution tracking
   - Critical for trading behavior insights

3. **Position Close Completion**
   - Missing executed/failed events
   - Incomplete transaction lifecycle tracking

#### Medium Priority (Analytics Completeness)

4. **Order Type Selection Events**

   - Missing user preference tracking
   - Incomplete trade setup analysis

5. **Partial Fill Tracking**

   - Missing for both trades and closes
   - Important for execution quality metrics

6. **Push Notification Events** (Assets team)
   - Missing liquidation/execution notifications
   - No user engagement with alerts

#### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

7. **Warning Display Events**

   - Missing validation feedback tracking

8. **Chart Time Series Changes**
   - Missing detailed chart interaction analysis

### Property Coverage Issues

Several implemented events are missing required properties:

- **Asset Screen Viewed**: Missing Open Position boolean
- **Trade Transaction Initiated**: Missing limit_price, fees, asset_price
- **Trade Transaction Submitted**: Missing margin_used, limit_price, fees, asset_price
- **Position Close Screen Viewed**: Missing unrealized\_%pnl, source, received_amount

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions

1. **Complete Trade Event Properties**

   - Add missing properties to initiated/submitted events
   - Ensure fee tracking consistency

2. **Implement Risk Management Events**

   - Add TP/SL setting events in TP/SL bottom sheet
   - Plan execution event integration with backend

3. **Complete Position Close Lifecycle**
   - Add executed/failed events to close position flow
   - Implement proper error handling tracking

#### Coordination Required

1. **Confirmation Team**: Coordinate deposit event implementation
2. **Assets Team**: Plan push notification event integration
3. **Backend Team**: Coordinate execution/liquidation event triggers

#### Testing Strategy

1. **Manual Testing**: Verify all ‚úÖ events fire correctly
2. **Property Validation**: Ensure all tracked properties match specification
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Verify error and failure scenario tracking

# Performance

- High Loading perps markets takes \~5 seconds to load
- High Loading perps tab in homescreen takes 2-3 sec to load
- Medium Updating TP/SL took 3 sec to update

# Questions

- On perps market overview:
  - How do we decide how many decimals to display for a given market? Seems it differs across markets
- Add sound when submitting an order
- Add haptic
  - when sliding any slider, ex: every 5% on position and every x for leverage
  - When slider leverage every 1x

# Random

**Wagmi Chart**

- Y axis doesn't display decimals, so we just see $0
- Load fast (\<1sec)

**Unrelated to Perps**

- Struggling to select password input box to open the app

 ### Running Tests

 ## Unit Tests

 ```bash
 yarn test:unit
 ```

## E2E Tests Overview

Our end-to-end (E2E) testing strategy leverages a combination of technologies to ensure robust test coverage for our mobile applications. We use Wix/Detox for the majority of our automation tests, Appium for specific non-functional testing like app upgrades and launch times, and Bitrise as our CI platform. All tests are written in JavaScript using Jest and Cucumber frameworks.

### Wix/Detox Tests

Detox serves as our primary mobile automation framework, with most of our tests written using it. Learn more about Wix/Detox [here](https://wix.github.io/Detox/).

**Supported Platforms**: iOS and Android  
**Test Location**: `e2e/specs`

#### Setup and Execution

- **Test Wallet**: Requires a wallet with access to testnet and mainnet. On Bitrise CI, this wallet is created using a secret recovery phrase from environment variables. For local testing, retrieve the phrase from the `.e2e.env` file.
- **Environment Variable**: Set `IS_TEST='true'` to enable the test environment. Refer to the `.e2e.env` file in the mobile 1Password vault for the complete list of environment variables.
- **Warning Logs**: Warning logs may sometimes cause test failures by interfering with automation interactions. To prevent this, disable warning logs during test execution.

#### Default Devices

- **iOS**: iPhone 15 Pro
- **Android**: Pixel 5 API 34

Ensure that these devices are set up. You can change the default devices at any time by updating the `device.type` in the Detox config located at `e2e/.detoxrc.js`.

#### Commands

- **Start Metro Server**: Ensure the Metro server is running before executing tests:

    ```bash
    yarn watch:clean
    ```

- **Build the Apps for Testing**:
  - **iOS Debug**: 

    ```bash
    yarn test:e2e:ios:debug:build
    ```

  - **Android Debug**: 

    ```bash
    yarn test:e2e:android:debug:build
    ```

- **Run All Tests Locally**:
  - **iOS Debug**:

    ```bash
    yarn test:e2e:ios:debug:run
    ```

  - **Android Debug**:

    ```bash
    yarn test:e2e:android:debug:run
    ```

_NOTE_: EXPO DOESN'T SUPPORT DETOX OUT OF THE BOX SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT, IN SLOWER COMPUTERS, LOADING FROM THE BUNDLER TAKES TOO LONG WHICH MAKES THE VERY FIRST TEST FAIL. THE FAILED TEST WILL THEN AUTOMATICALLY RESTART AND IT SHOULD WORK FROM THEN ON.

- **Run Specific Tests**:
  - **iOS**:

    ```bash
    yarn test:e2e:ios:debug:run e2e/specs/TEST_NAME.spec.js
    ```

  - **Android**:

    UPDATE: with the implementation of Expo, mobile app will need to be manually loaded on emulator before running automated E2E tests.

    - install a build on the emulator
      - either install the apk or keep an existing install on the emulator
    - on the metro server hit 'a' on the keyboard as indicated by metro for launching emulator
    - if emulator fails to launch you can launch emulator in another terminal
      ```bash
      emulator -avd <emulator-name>
      ```
      - on the metro server hit 'a' on the keyboard as indicated by metro for launching emulator
    - you don't need to repeat these steps unless emulator or metro server is restarted

    ```bash
    yarn test:e2e:android:debug:run e2e/specs/TEST_NAME.spec.js
    ```

- **Run Tests by Tag (e.g., Smoke)**:
  - **iOS**:

    ```bash
    yarn test:e2e:ios:debug:run --testNamePattern="Smoke"
    ```

  - **Android**:

    ```bash
    yarn test:e2e:android:debug:run --testNamePattern="Smoke"
    ```

### Appium
**Platform**: Android  
**Test Location**: `wdio`

We currently utilize [Appium](https://appium.io/), [Webdriver.io](http://webdriver.io/), and [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) to test the application launch times and the upgrade between different versions. As a brief explanation, webdriver.io is the test framework that uses Appium Server as a service. This is responsible for communicating between our tests and devices, and cucumber as the test framework. 

## Configuration for Testing

We have two separate configurations for testing the different variants of our applications:

- **QA Variant (local)**: Runs in debug mode on your local machine.
- **QA Variant (production)**: Runs in production mode on BrowserStack.

We use the QA variant for Appium tests because of our screen-blocking mechanism, which would otherwise prevent tests from getting past the wallet setup screen.

### Capabilities Setup

We require two sets of capabilities to handle app upgrade tests, leading to the creation of two configurations: `defaultCapabilities` and `upgradeCapabilities`.

#### Default Capabilities

```javascript
const defaultCapabilities = [
  {
    platformName: 'Android',
    noReset: false,
    fullReset: false,
    maxInstances: 1,
    build: 'Android App Launch Times Tests',
    device: process.env.BROWSERSTACK_DEVICE || 'Google Pixel 6',
    os_version: process.env.BROWSERSTACK_OS_VERSION || '12.0',
    app: process.env.BROWSERSTACK_APP_URL,
    'browserstack.debug': true,
    'browserstack.local': true,
  }
];
```

This configuration is our standard, as it only requires one app per install.

#### Upgrade Capabilities

```javascript
const upgradeCapabilities = [
  {
    platformName: 'Android',
    noReset: false,
    fullReset: false,
    maxInstances: 1,
    build: 'Android App Upgrade Tests',
    device: process.env.BROWSERSTACK_DEVICE || 'Google Pixel 6',
    os_version: process.env.BROWSERSTACK_OS_VERSION || '12.0',
    app: process.env.PRODUCTION_APP_URL || process.env.BROWSERSTACK_APP_URL,
    'browserstack.debug': true,
    'browserstack.local': true,
    'browserstack.midSessionInstallApps': [process.env.BROWSERSTACK_APP_URL],
  }
];
```

This configuration requires two applications: the current production app and the app built from the branch.

**Note**: You can, if you choose to, run the tests against any one of the devices and operating systems mentioned in the browserstack device [list](https://www.browserstack.com/list-of-browsers-and-platforms/app_automate). 

### Flag-Based Capability Selection

We use flags like `--performance` and `--upgrade` to determine which capabilities to use for specific tests.

```javascript
const { selectedCapabilities, defaultTagExpression } = (() => {
  if (isAppUpgrade) {
    return {
      selectedCapabilities: upgradeCapabilities,
      defaultTagExpression: '@upgrade and @androidApp',
    };
  } else if (isPerformance) {
    return {
      selectedCapabilities: defaultCapabilities,
      defaultTagExpression: '@performance and @androidApp',
    };
  } else {
    return {
      selectedCapabilities: defaultCapabilities,
      defaultTagExpression: '@smoke and @androidApp',
    };
  }
})();
```

## Initial Setup

Before running tests, you need to perform an initial setup:

```bash
yarn setup
```

## Running Tests Locally Against QA Build

You can run your E2E tests on local simulators either in development mode (with automatic code refresh) or without it. 

### iOS

To start an iOS QA build:

```bash
yarn start:ios:qa
```

### Android

To start an Android QA build:

```bash
yarn start:android:qa
```

Ensure that the bundler compiles all files before running the tests to avoid build breaks. Use:

```bash
yarn watch:clean
```

Then, run the tests on the simulator:

### iOS

```bash
yarn test:wdio:ios
```

### Android

```bash
yarn test:wdio:android
```

To run specific tests, use the `--spec` option:

```bash
yarn test:wdio:android --spec ./wdio/features/performance/ColdStartLaunchTimes.feature
```

**Note**: Ensure that your installed simulator names match the configurations in `wdio/config/android.config.debug.js` and `wdio/config/ios.config.debug.js`.

## Running Tests on BrowserStack

To trigger tests locally on BrowserStack:

1. Retrieve your BrowserStack username and access key from the App Automate section.
2. Update `config.user` and `config.key` in `android.config.browserstack` with your BrowserStack credentials.
3. Upload your app to BrowserStack via the `create_qa_builds_pipeline`. Grab the `app_url` from `browserstack_uploaded_apps.json`.
4. Update `process.env.BROWSERSTACK_APP_URL` with the correct `app_url`.
5. Run your tests using the appropriate flag (e.g., for performance tests):

```bash
yarn test:wdio:android:browserstack --performance
```

## Running Appium Tests on CI (Bitrise)

You can also run Appium tests on CI using Bitrise pipelines:

- `app_launch_times_pipeline`
- `app_upgrade_pipeline`

For more details on our CI pipelines, see the [Bitrise Pipelines Overview](#bitrise-pipelines-overview).

### API Spec Tests

**Platform**: iOS  
**Test Location**: `e2e/api-specs/json-rpc-coverage.js`

The API Spec tests use the `@open-rpc/test-coverage` tool to generate tests from our [api-specs](https://github.com/MetaMask/api-specs) OpenRPC Document. These tests are currently executed only on iOS and use the same build as the Detox tests for iOS.

- **Test Coverage Tool**: The `test-coverage` tool uses `Rules` and `Reporters` to generate and report test results. These are passed as parameters in the test coverage tool call located in [e2e/api-specs/json-rpc-coverage.js](../../e2e/api-specs/json-rpc-coverage.js). For more details on `Rules` and `Reporters`, refer to the [OpenRPC test coverage documentation](https://github.com/open-rpc/test-coverage?tab=readme-ov-file#extending-with-a-rule).

#### Commands

1. **Build the App**:

    ```bash
    yarn test:e2e:ios:debug:build
    ```

2. **Run API Spec Tests**:

    ```bash
    yarn test:api-specs
    ```

### Bitrise Pipelines Overview

Our CI/CD process is automated through various Bitrise pipelines, each designed to streamline and optimize different aspects of our E2E testing.

#### **1. PR_Smoke_e2e_Pipeline**

- **Triggers**: 
  - **When "Run Smoke E2E" label is applied to a Pull request**: Automatically runs smoke tests.
- **Manual Trigger**: Select the desired branch in the Bitrise dashboard and choose `pr_smoke_e2e_pipeline` from the pipeline dropdown menu.

#### **2. PR_Regression_e2e_Pipeline**

- **Triggers**: 
  - **Nightly**: Automatically runs all regression tests against main branch.
- **Manual Trigger**: Select the main branch (or another branch of choice) in the Bitrise dashboard and choose `pr_regression_e2e_pipeline` from the pipeline dropdown menu.

#### **3. Release_e2e_Pipeline**

- **Workflows**:
  - **Build**: Creates iOS and Android artifacts.
  - **Test**: Executes regression tests across both platforms.
- **Manual Trigger**: Typically run on release branches but can be manually triggered in the Bitrise dashboard.

#### **4. App Launch Times Pipeline**

- **Function**: Measures and monitors app launch times on real devices using BrowserStack to ensure consistent performance over time.
- **Nightly**: Automatically runs on the main branch.
- **Manual Trigger**: Select the desired branch in the Bitrise dashboard and choose `app_upgrade_pipeline` from the pipeline dropdown menu. 

#### **5. App Upgrade Pipeline**

- **Function**: Automates testing of app upgrades to verify smooth transitions between versions.
- **Configuration**: Requires the `PRODUCTION_APP_URL` environment variable to be set with the current production build's BrowserStack URL.You would need to search and update `PRODUCTION_APP_URL` in the bitrise.yml with the production browserstack build URL. 
- **Manual Trigger**: Select the desired branch in the Bitrise dashboard and choose `app_upgrade_pipeline` from the pipeline dropdown menu. 

### Test Reports in Bitrise

- **Detox Tests**: Test reports are displayed directly in the Bitrise UI, offering a visual representation of test results and execution details. Screenshots on test failures are also captured and stored in a zip file. You can download these screenshots from the `Artifacts` tab in Bitrise.
- **API Spec and Appium Tests**: HTML reporters generate and display test results. Access these HTML reports through the Bitrise build artifacts section for detailed analysis.

### Debugging Failed Tests

- **Example**:
    ```
    FAIL e2e/specs/swaps/swap-action-smoke.spec.js (232.814 s)
      SmokeSwaps Swap from Actions
        ✓ should Swap .05 'ETH' to 'USDT' (90488 ms)
        ✕ should Swap 100 'USDT' to 'ETH' (50549 ms)
      ● SmokeSwaps Swap from Actions › should Swap 100 'USDT' to 'ETH'
        Test Failed: Timed out while waiting for expectation: TOBEVISIBLE WITH MATCHER(id == “swap-quote-summary”) TIMEOUT(15s)
        HINT: To print view hierarchy on failed actions/matches, use log-level verbose or higher.
          163 |     return await waitFor(element(by.id(elementId)))
          164 |       .toBeVisible()
        > 165 |       .withTimeout(15000);
            |        ^
          166 |   }
          167 |
          168 |   static async checkIfNotVisible(elementId) {
        at Function.withTimeout (e2e/helpers.js:165:8)
        ...
    ```
    In this example, the test failed because the `swap-quote-summary` ID was not found. This issue could be due to a changed testID or the swap quotes not being visible. 
    To confirm whether either case is true, we then look at the screenshots on failure. 

    [Here](https://app.screencast.com/H2vVLK5jP4NHe) we can see that the swaps quotes in fact did not load hence why the tests failed. 
    

### Smoke Tests Breakdown

- **Per Team**: Smoke tests are divided by team, allowing targeted verification of core functionalities pertinent to each team's responsibilities.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Faster Feedback**: Running a subset of tests on PRs provides quicker feedback, ensuring critical functionalities are validated without the overhead of executing all tests.
  - **Efficient Resource Use**: Limits resource consumption and test execution time, optimizing CI/CD pipeline performance.

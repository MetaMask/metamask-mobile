Hi @RyanMYXFinance,

Quick update on SDK integration progress (v0.1.247):

Working ✅:
- Public HTTP API (getPoolSymbolAll, getTickerList, getKlineList)
- getAccountInfo (returns account data)
- WebSocket connection (connects successfully)

Not working ❌:
- subscription.auth() returns 9401 Unauthorized
- listPositions() and getOrders() return "Failed to obtain accessToken"

The issue: The SDK requires a getAccessToken callback, but I can't find documentation on how to generate a valid token. I tried:
- Wallet signatures (personal_sign)
- Address-based tokens
- JSON/Base64 payloads

All fail with 9401.

Questions:
1. Is there a backend endpoint I need to call to get the accessToken? (e.g., /auth/token)
2. What format should the token be in?
3. Is appId registration required?

Could you share a working code example or point me to the auth documentation?

Thanks!

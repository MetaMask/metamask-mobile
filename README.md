MetaMask is a mobile web browser that provides easy access to websites that use the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain.

## MetaMask Mobile

### Building Locally

The code is built using React-Native and running code locally requires a Mac or Linux OS.
- Install [sentry-cli](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli) tools: `brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-cli`

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **version 10 (latest stable) and yarn@1 (latest)**
  - If you are using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (recommended) running `nvm use` will automatically choose the right node version for you.

- Install the shared React Native dependencies (`React Native CLI`, _not_ `Expo CLI`)
  - [macOS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies-1)
  - [Linux](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies-2)

- Install [cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) by running:

```bash 
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

- _MetaMask Only:_ Rename the `.*.env.example` files (remove the `.example`) in the root of the project and fill in the appropriate values for each key. Get the values from another MetaMask Mobile developer.

- Clone this repo and install our dependencies:

```bash
git clone ...
cd metamask-mobile
yarn install # this will run a lengthy postinstall flow
cd ios && pod install && cd .. # install pods for iOS
```

- _Non-MetaMask Only:_ In the project root folder run
```
  cp .ios.env.example .ios.env && \
  cp .android.env.example .android.env && \
  cp .js.env.example .js.env
 ``` 
- _Non-MetaMask Only:_ Create an account and generate your own API key at [Infura](https://infura.io) in order to connect to main and test nets. Fill `MM_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` in `.js.env`. (App will run without it, but will not be able to connect to actual network.)

- Then, in one terminal, run:

```bash
yarn watch
```

#### Android

- Install the Android SDK, via [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
  - _MetaMask Only:_ To create production builds, you need to install Google Play Licensing Library via the SDK Manager in Android Studio.
- Linux only:
  - Ensure that you have the `secret-tool` binary on your machine.
    - Part of the [libsecret-tools](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+package/libsecret-tools) package on Debian/Ubuntu based distributions.
- Install the correct emulator
  - Follow the instructions at:
    - [React Native Getting Started - Android](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies-1) _(React Native CLI Quickstart -> [your OS] -> Android)_
    - More details can be found [on the Android Developer site](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)
  - You should use the following:
    - **Android OS Version:** Latest, unless told otherwise
    - **Device:** Google Pixel 3
- Finally, start the emulator from Android Studio, and run:

```bash
yarn start:android
```

#### iOS

- Install the iOS dependencies
  - [React Native Getting Started - iOS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies-1) _(React Native CLI Quickstart -> [your OS] -> iOS)_
    - You do **not** need CocoaPods
- Install the correct simulator
  - **iOS OS Version:** Latest, unless told otherwise
  - **Device:** iPhone 11 Pro

```bash
yarn start:ios
```

#### Build Troubleshooting

Unfortunately, the build system may fail to pick up local changes, such as installing new NPM packages or `yarn link`ing a dependency.
If the app is behaving strangely or not picking up your local changes, it may be due to build issues.
To ensure that you're starting with a clean slate, close all emulators/simulators, stop the `yarn watch` process, and run:

```bash
yarn clean

# if you're going to `yarn link` any packages,
# do that here, before the next command

yarn watch:clean

# ...and then, in another terminal

yarn start:ios

# or

yarn start:android
```

If `yarn link` fails after going through these steps, try directly `yarn add`ing the local files instead.

### Debugging

First, make sure you have the following running:

- `yarn watch`
- Your Android emulator or iOS simulator
- `yarn start:android` or `yarn start:ios`

Next, check that the React Native Debugger is working:

- Open your emulator or simulator, and select `Debug JS Remotely` (or something similar) from its developer menu
- To open the developer menu:
  - iOS Simulator: `Cmd + D`
  - Android Emulator
    - macOS: `Cmd + M`
	- Windows, Linux: `Ctrl + M`
- If it doesn't open automatically, try navigating to this URL in Chrome: http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui/
- If these steps do not take you to the React Native Debugger, something is wrong

#### Debugging iOS (macOS Only)

For more details, see [this page](https://medium.com/@mattcroak718/debugging-your-iphone-mobile-web-app-using-safari-development-tools-71240657c487).

- You should be able to inspect the mobile app using the console in the React Native Debugger in Chrome
- To debug a website (dapp) in the browser:
  - Navigate to the website in the app's browser
  - Open Safari
    - Go to: _Preferences -> Advanced_ and select `Show Develop menu in menu bar`
  - Select `Develop` in the menu bar
    - Find your simulator in the second section from the top
    - Select the relevant WebView from the list
      - The simulator will highlight the WebView when you hover over it in Safari

#### Debugging Android

For more details, see [this page](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/webviews).

- You should be able to inspect the mobile app using the console in the React Native Debugger in Chrome
- To debug a website (dapp) in the browser:
  - Navigate to the website in the app's browser
  - Go to chrome://inspect
  - Select the relevant WebView under **Remote Target**

### Running Tests

#### Unit Tests

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

#### E2E Tests (iOS)

```bash
yarn test:e2e:ios
```

#### E2E Tests (Android)

```bash
yarn test:e2e:android
```

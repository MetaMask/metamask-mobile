# Product Guidelines

## Content & Tone

- **Prose Style:** Professional & Direct.
- **Voice:** Authoritative yet accessible. Documentation and user-facing strings should be concise, clear, and minimize unnecessary jargon.
- **Precision:** Prioritize clarity and accuracy. Use consistent terminology across all platforms and documentation.

## UI & Design Principles

- **Design System Primacy:** **MMDS (MetaMask Design System)** is the source of truth for all new UI development.
- **Consistency:** Maintain strict adherence to MMDS tokens (colors, spacing, typography) and components.
- **Legacy Components:** The use of legacy design system components is restricted to the maintenance and bug-fixing of existing views. Any new feature or significant refactor must utilize MMDS.
- **Accessibility:** UI components must be designed and implemented with accessibility (A11y) in mind, following standard mobile accessibility guidelines.

## Development Standards

- **Component Reusability:** Favor the use of existing MMDS components over creating custom UI elements.
- **Design Alignment:** Implementation must match the provided design specifications (e.g., Figma) with high fidelity.

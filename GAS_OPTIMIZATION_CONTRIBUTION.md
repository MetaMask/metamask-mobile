# Gas Fee Optimization Enhancement

## Overview

This contribution introduces intelligent gas fee optimization capabilities to MetaMask Mobile, helping users optimize transaction costs through dynamic gas price recommendations based on network conditions.

## Technical Implementation

### Files Added

1. **`app/util/gasOptimization.js`** - Core optimization algorithms
2. **`app/util/__tests__/gasOptimization.test.js`** - Comprehensive test suite  
3. **`app/components/UI/GasOptimizationSuggestions/index.js`** - React component for UI integration

### Key Features

- **Network Congestion Analysis**: Analyzes pending transactions and gas price volatility
- **Strategy-Based Optimization**: Provides Economy, Standard, Fast, and Urgent gas strategies
- **Transaction Batching**: Identifies opportunities to batch transactions for gas savings
- **Safe Error Handling**: Prevents division by zero and handles edge cases gracefully

### API

#### `analyzeNetworkCongestion(networkData)`
Analyzes network conditions and returns congestion level.

**Parameters:**
- `networkData.pendingTransactions` - Number of pending transactions
- `networkData.averageGasPrice` - BigNumber average gas price
- `networkData.medianGasPrice` - BigNumber median gas price

**Returns:** String congestion level ('low', 'moderate', 'high', 'extreme')

#### `calculateOptimalGasPrice(strategy, congestionLevel, baseGasPrice, priorityFee)`
Calculates optimized gas prices based on strategy and network conditions.

**Parameters:**
- `strategy` - Gas optimization strategy
- `congestionLevel` - Current network congestion
- `baseGasPrice` - BigNumber base gas price
- `priorityFee` - BigNumber priority fee

**Returns:** Object with optimized gas configuration

### Testing

The test suite covers:
- Network congestion analysis with various scenarios
- Gas price optimization calculations
- Transaction batching suggestions  
- Edge cases (zero values, undefined inputs)
- Error handling and graceful degradation

### Integration

The `GasOptimizationSuggestions` component can be integrated into existing gas fee editing flows to provide users with intelligent recommendations and cost-saving strategies.

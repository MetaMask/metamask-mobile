# Gas Fee Optimization Enhancement

**Author:** Anthony Ogugua (CEO/CTO, trustBank)  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Type:** Feature Enhancement  

## Overview

This contribution introduces intelligent gas fee optimization capabilities to MetaMask Mobile, helping users save on transaction costs while maintaining reliability. The enhancement leverages advanced algorithms to analyze network conditions and provide dynamic gas price recommendations.

## Problem Statement

MetaMask's current gas fee system uses basic static calculations that don't account for:
- Real-time network congestion patterns
- User transaction urgency preferences  
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Transaction batching possibilities

This results in users often overpaying for gas fees or experiencing delayed transactions.

## Solution

### Core Features

1. **Dynamic Gas Price Optimization**
   - Analyzes network congestion in real-time
   - Provides strategy-based recommendations (Economy, Standard, Fast, Urgent)
   - Calculates optimal gas prices based on current conditions

2. **Intelligent Network Analysis**
   - Monitors pending transaction volumes
   - Tracks gas price volatility
   - Categorizes congestion levels (Low, Moderate, High, Extreme)

3. **Transaction Batching Suggestions**
   - Identifies opportunities to batch multiple transactions
   - Calculates potential gas savings from batching
   - Provides user-friendly recommendations

4. **User-Centric Recommendations**
   - Considers transaction urgency
   - Accounts for user cost sensitivity
   - Provides timing suggestions during high congestion

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Added/Modified

1. **`app/util/gasOptimization.js`** - Core optimization algorithms
2. **`app/util/__tests__/gasOptimization.test.js`** - Comprehensive test suite
3. **`app/components/UI/GasOptimizationSuggestions/index.js`** - React component for UI integration

#### Key Algorithms

**Network Congestion Analysis:**
```javascript
function analyzeNetworkCongestion(networkData) {
  const { pendingTransactions, averageGasPrice, medianGasPrice } = networkData;
  
  // Calculate gas price volatility indicator
  const priceVolatility = averageGasPrice.minus(medianGasPrice)
    .dividedBy(medianGasPrice)
    .abs();
  
  // Determine congestion level based on pending transactions and price volatility
  if (pendingTransactions > 50000 || priceVolatility.gt(0.5)) {
    return NETWORK_CONGESTION_LEVELS.EXTREME;
  }
  // ... additional logic
}
```

**Optimal Gas Price Calculation:**
```javascript
function calculateOptimalGasPrice(strategy, congestionLevel, baseGasPrice, priorityFee) {
  // Strategy-based multipliers for different network conditions
  const multipliers = strategyMultipliers[strategy][congestionLevel];
  
  const optimizedMaxFeePerGas = baseFee
    .multipliedBy(multipliers.base)
    .plus(currentPriorityFee.multipliedBy(multipliers.priority));
    
  return {
    maxFeePerGas: optimizedMaxFeePerGas,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: optimizedMaxPriorityFeePerGas,
    estimatedConfirmationTime: getEstimatedConfirmationTime(strategy, congestionLevel),
    potentialSavings: calculatePotentialSavings(baseFee, currentPriorityFee, optimizedMaxFeePerGas)
  };
}
```

## Benefits

- Network switching logic

### API Requirements
The system requires access to:
- Current network gas price data
- Pending transaction pool information
- Historical gas price trends
- User transaction history (for personalization)

## Testing

### Test Coverage
